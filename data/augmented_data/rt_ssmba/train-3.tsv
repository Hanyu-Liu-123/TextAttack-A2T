prurient playthings aside, there's little to say about this english trifle.	0
this is a train wreck of an expensive film - - a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force - feed james bond into the mindless nox mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet, full of bright flashes and loud bangs.	0
the film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity of adrenaline week than dark, decadent truffle.	0

it seems to me a film is about the art of ripping people off without letting letting them consciously know you have done so	0
it's just disappointingly superficial - - a movie always has the the elements necessary to be a fascinating drama involving character study, but never does more than scratch the surface.	0

[ denis'] bare - bones narrative more closely resembles an outline for a'70s exploitation picture than the band formula.	0

writer - director walter hill and co - writer david giler try to create characters out of the obvious cliches, but wind up using them as punching bags.	0
there's a scientific law to be discerned here that producers would be well to heed. mediocre movies start to drag as soon as the action speeds up ; when the explosions start, methods fall to shit.	0
just cockeyed shot all the worse.	0
inexpensive and beautifully photographed ( somebody suggested the stills might make a nice coffee table book ), but afterwards we'll leave the theater wondering why these people mattered.	0

it's a fanboy'competition what?'brought to life on the big screen.	0
the convict itself is actually quite vapid.	0

deep down, i realized the harsh reality of my decision : i would leave the theater with a lower i. q. ultimately if i had entered.	0
a really funny fifteen - minute short that testing its limits to fill an almost feature - length space.	0
aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the database feardotal. com or an improperly hamming performance from poor stephen rewi, the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand.	0
it is bad work but certainly not without merit as entertainment.	0
for its 100 year running time, they'll wait in vain for a movie to happen.	0
a work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse.	0

it might not be 1970s animation, but everything about about it is straight from the sunday morning cartoons a retread story, bad writing, and the same 2014 silliness.	0
the script seems uncertain whether it wants to be the acidic all - male all about eve or a lush, crooning melodrama in the intermezzo strain.	0
tends to plэ.	0
a nearly 21 / 22 hours, the film is way too indulgent ;	0
gorgeous to look at but insufferably tedious and very lucid mic eating. a curiously constricted epic.	0
it looks much more like a cartoon in the end than the simpsons ever has.	0
with achai editorial process and firmer direction, material could work, especially since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent, but as is, personality tends to be idling and neutral.	0
doesn new calculus really add up to much.	0
it's better suited to the history or hooks conducting, but there's no arguing the tone of the conversation - it leaves a bad taste in your mouth and questions on your mind.	0
an entertainment so in love with its hyperinflated mythology that it no longer recognizes the needs of horror portrayers for real characters and compelling plots.	0
a prolonged protrusion of psychoactive pulp.	0
borrows from other movies like spy in the most ordinary and obvious fashion.	0
it's surprisingly bland despite the heavy doses of weird performances and it.	0
"a chilly, remote, emotionally distant piece... so dull that its tagline could be posted "" in space, no one can hear you snore.."	0
the characters seem one - dimensional, and the film is superficial and will probably draw draw interest primarily to its target audience.	0
cervino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish, and the local scene really comes alive. poor hermocrates and leontine pathetically compare notes on their budding amours.	0
it's like a drive - by. you can drive right by it without seeing anything special, save for a few comic turns, intended and otherwise.	0
everything - - even life on an aircraft carrier - - is sentimental stuff.	0
this would not be'james bond for the extreme generation'pic is one big, dumb adventure movie. stress was dumb. '	0
this movie has many virtues, and despite a lot of involved talent, was done by the numbers.	0
when your subject is illusion versus reality, shouldn't the reality seem at least passably real?	0

a fan film that for the uninitiated plays better on magnetic with the sound turned down.	0
too infuriatingly quirky and taken with my own style.	0
there's a whole heap of nothing at the core of this whole coming - of - - - coming - out tale.	0
as much as i laughed throughout the movie, i cannot mount a pungent defense of the film as entertainment, or even as violence, although the movie will leave you marveling at these guys'superhuman ability to withstand pain.	0
the airing of dumb hands breaks down exercise in stereotypes that gives the [ teen comedy ] genre a bad name.	0
distinctly sub - par... more likely to wake a viewer in boredom than to send any cold down his spine.	0
sound like a bad blend of an overripe episode of tv's dawson's creek and the recycled and dumbed - down canvas of love story.	0
unless you get want to walk in with a skateboard under your arm, you're going to feel like you weren't invited to the party.	0

a sluggish pace and lack of genuine narrative crater the movie in every bit as much as life hemss the spirits of these young women.	0
a low - budget affair, tadpole was based on digital video, where the images often look smeary and blurry, to the point of distraction. then again, in a better movie, you might not have noticed.	0

a late monday night cable sexploitation romp masquerading as a thriller about the ruthless social order that governs college cliques.	0
falls short in explaining the music and its condition.	0
diagnosis inspires more than an interested detachment.	0
what might have emerged as a lunacy at the hands of woody allen or mel brooks ( at least during their'ridiculous heyday ) comes across as lame and sophomoric as this debut indie feature.	0
despite slick production values and director roger mann ebert's tick - tock pacing, the final effect was from having two guys yelling in your face for two hours.	0
pretty much sucks, but has a funny moment or two.	0
they do a good job of painting this family connection for the audience but they tried to incorporate join many elements into the film.	0
a categories mystery that doesn't know whether it wants to be a suspenseful horror movie or a gothic romantic melodrama. it ends up being neither, and fails at both endeavors.	0
two completely interlocked stories drowned by all too appealing complexity.	0
it is so earnest, so overwrought, so wildly implausible that it begs to be parodied.	0
these were textbook lives of quiet desperation.	0
swimsuit, like fatal attraction, eventually goes overboard with a loony melodramatic denouement in which a high spelling swimming tub substitutes for a bathtub.	0
claims : sort the bad component from the good, which is its essential problem.	0
purposefully shocking in its romanticized gore, if unintentionally dull in its mix of poetical glimpses.	0
