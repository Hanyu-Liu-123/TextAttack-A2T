The energetic frontman is in a good mood and his enthusiasm can hardly be resisted, even if the filmmakers don't come up with anything original in slapstick sequences.	1

a diverse and amazingly articulate occupation of Palestinian and Israeli children	1
light but entertaining documentary.	1
"""The film is crass, direct and deadly.   An unnatural calm that is occasionally shaken.   Bursts of rage and later violent jealousy."	1

"Worse than ""Silence of the Lambs"" better than ""Hannibal"""	1
Those who have not seen the film lately may be surprised by the diversity of tones in Spielberg's work. Much of it is funny, but there are some surprising, surreal moments.	1

It takes a close look at fragile, complex relationships.	1
Not a bad choice, provided that.   The air conditioning in the theatre works perfectly.	1
A beautiful effort, an interesting subject, some fascinating characters and a sad ending. The big finish was certainly not what Galinsky and Hawley had planned.   But being a good documentary maker is part of being there when the rope breaks.	1

There are moments of mirth.	1
Refreshing.	1
a hypnotic portrait of this sad, compulsive life	1

At its most basic, this cartoon adventure is so exhilarating.	1

a moving and weighty account of a family's attempts to heal after a child's death	1

It's exciting, extremely fast and ultimately.   I dare say entertaining!	1
the captivating performances of the incredibly flexible cast make love a joy.	1
Magnificent as Nadja, a Russian shipping bride who comes to America and does not speak a word of English, it is Kidman who holds the film together with an exceedingly cheesy performance that gradually piles more layers.	1

A haunting tale of murder and chaos.	1

It's hard to imagine anyone managing to steal a movie from not only the charismatic rising star Jake Gyllenhaal, but also the accomplished Oscar winners Susan Sarandon, Dustin Hoffman and Holly Hunter, but newcomer ellen pompeo manages the feat with flying colours.	1

Labute masterfully balances both traditional and modern stories in a way that never overwhelms the other. Something for everyone.	1
Irwin is so serious that it is hard to resist his pleas to conserve wildlife and respect its environment. There are much worse messages for a young audience that will probably be perfectly happy with the sloppy slapstick comedy.	1

It is not about fear, but about a mood in which a menacing, omnipresent and unknown threat lurks just below the proceedings and creates an almost constant tension.	1

It's a perfect show of respect just for one of those underrated professionals who deserve it but rarely get it.	1
For all its twists, some of which border on bizarre at the end of the film, Bloodwork is a strong character-driven piece.	1

A compelling picture of law enforcement and a haunting, nasty journey into urban chaos.	1
Director Douglas mcgrath takes it with all the half-hearted zeal of an eighth-grade boy dealing with reading.	1
is a document of what it felt like to be a New Yorker - or really a human being - in the weeks after September 11.	1
I'm generally not a big fan of cartoons from TV shows, but hey arnold! The film is clever, quirky and even brave enough to overcome my resistance.	1

a powerful exploration of hypocrisy, self-awareness, self-hatred and self-determination.	1

All in all, it is a very entertaining, thought-provoking film with a simple message: God is love.	1
It may not be a great piece of cinematography, but its power comes from the point of view of its soul, how well-meaning paternalism masks a social injustice, at least as it is presented in this case.	1

The grainy photography is an otherwise delightful comedy of errors.	1
This film is not a love letter to the murdered rappers, but a mockery - a call for justice for two crimes from which many of us have not yet recovered.	1
The film impresses with the sight and sounds of the wondrous beats of the world.	1
Daily struggles and simple joys usurp the message of the sermon, so that by the time the credits roll on the end of the knock, there is a warm, fuzzy feeling.	1

an overbearing and ultimately empty investigation of a sick and evil woman	0
The country has no scenes that upset or frighten young viewers. Unfortunately, there is almost nothing in this flat effort that would amuse or entertain them.	0
The cumulative effect of this 65-minute trifle is more like being trapped as a strange relative trots out the video he took from the family holiday to Stonehenge. Soon one yearns desperately for the end of the evening.	0
The figures are never more than sketches.   , which frustratingly leaves any real emotional connection or identification out of reach.	0
Matteis's underdeveloped efforts here are nothing more than a comfortable conveyor belt of brooding personalities running around as if they were returning from the camp of tribal characters - a sleepy drama beguiled by his own overbearing self-examination.	0
Only in his last surprising shots does the rabbit-proof fence find the authority it seeks.	0

You get what you expect.   The bar for expectations, however, was not raised above sixth grade.	0
Barry Sonnenfeld owes the pug big time	0
The biggest problem with Roger Avary's revolt against the mpaa is that, despite the director's fame, he made a film that hardly shocked, hardly interesting and, above all, hardly anything.	0

I went up to the usher and said that if she had to sit through it again, she should ask for an increase.	0
Serious but ponderous.	0
If Sini's character had a brain, his ordeal would be over in five minutes, but instead the plot does everything it can to create obstacles he can stumble across.	0
Too slow for a younger audience, too flat for an older one	0
"There's a reason the studio didn't offer a preview. ' The Adventures of Pluto-Nash ""is a big stinker."	0
A punchline without a premise, a joke made up entirely of musty memories of half-dimensional characters.	0
takes one character that we do not like and another one that we do not believe, and puts them in a battle of wills that is impossible to care about and not particularly funny.	0
The things this film is trying to get audiences to buy won't go down well with most intelligent viewers.	0
Even if the tantalizing prospect of many sober young actors in a film about campus depravity did not fade amid the conscious, tedious ugliness, it would be tiresome by Avary's failure to construct a story with even a hint of dramatic interest.	0
sitting through the last reel (spoiler alert!) is considerably less charming than listening to a four-year-old with a penchant for hyperbole recounting his Halloween trip to the haunted house.	0
confuses his message with an ultimate desire to please, and distorting into a notion of expectation is the last thing any of these three actresses or their characters deserve.	0
Deathly boring, pointless meditation on losers in a remote hotel	0
With this new rollerball role, sense and sensitivity have been overrun by what can only be described as robotic emotion.	0
One can only assume that the jury that awarded Star Hoffman's brother Gordy the Waldo Salt screenplay prize at the 2002 Sundance Festival honored an attempt to do something other than actually remove him	0
A film that should be prescribed more than recommended - visually bland like a dentist's waiting room, complete with soothing muzak and a cushion of predictable narrative rhythms.	0

The script deals with big, heavy subjects in a bland, superficial way that offers no insight into why good things happen to bad people, for example.	0

boring and mechanical, somehow like a very stupid museum piece	0
There is no point of view, no contemporary interpretation of John's pre-feminist predicament, so we think the only reason to make the film is that current standards allow a lot of nudity.	0

A lady's heart may be in the right place, but he needs to get his head out of his ass	0
There is no doubt that this is a highly ambitious and personal project for egoists, but it is also one that, alongside its best work, feels clumsy and confused.	0
Despite fancy touches, it rarely seems to interest anyone who is kicking around a raison d'etre as fresh-faced as their young guns.	0
It's all pretty tame. The most offensive thing about the film is that Hollywood expects people to pay for it.	0
The film is a mess from start to finish.	0
The problem with making this queen a thoroughly modern girl is that it also makes her look foolish and superficial, rather than a victim of mental illness, as was more likely.	0
I'm not saying the Ice Age doesn't have pretty pictures, but there's not enough substance in history to breathe life into them.	0
In telling a largely untold story, bui chooses something that is ultimately suspiciously familiar.	0
The plot is nothing more than hackneyed clichés from start to finish, and the script assumes that not only would the target audience lose subtlety, but that it's too stupid to realize that they've seen this very film a hundred times before	0
The production of brain dead is incurable.	0
Some episodes work, others don't.	0
beautifully filmed and well acted.   admittedly problematic in its narrative specifics.	0
She will earn her share of the Christmas cake, although the film makes one thing very clear: she is a pretty woman, not a working girl.	0
Rymer doesn't trust laughter - and doesn't have the respect for the entire Dead Undead genre, which deserves more from a vampire picture than some flashy special effects.	0
"The film's soprano gags are not only incredibly old-fashioned and unfunny, they also show how desperate the makers of this sequel to ""We Do It for Money"" were."	0
Wow. I haven't been so disappointed in a movie for a long time.	0

It is a sign of poverty how Nettelbeck sees working women - or at least this working woman - for whom she shows little sympathy.	0
Watching Harris dissolve physically and emotionally as the film progresses has a certain sharpness to it, given his recent death, but Boyd's film offers little else.	0
It is also curious that this film, like the similarly poorly timed Antitrust Law, is just as bad on a fraction of the budget.	0
"""Ejemplo de una cinta en que no importa el talento de su reparto o lo interesante que pudo haber resultado su premisa, pues el resultado es francamente aburrido y, por momentos, deplorable."	0

The problem is not that everything is derivative, because many funny films recycle old tropes The problem is that van Wilder doesn't do much that is actually funny with the material.	0
Infidelity is not interesting at all.	0
None of this is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think.	0
A processed comedy.	0
Like a screen show, Star Trek: Nemesis is even more reminiscent of a 65th-grade reunion, with only eight surviving members turning up - and nothing to drink.	0
Fails as a dystopian film, as a retooling of The Matrix	0
Full of the kind of obnoxious chatter that only self-conscious neurotics do.	0
An erotic thriller that is neither too erotic nor too exciting.	0
Like Bartleby, the film is something of a stiff upper lip - an extra-dry office comedy that seems twice as long as its 83 minutes.	0

If you value time and money, find an escape clause and avoid this banal, predictable repeat.	0
The director and her capable cast seem caught up in a heady whirlwind of new, age-inspired good intentions, but the magic they exert is not in the least fascinating.	0
"Everything is tied to the groove of a New York dating comedy that simplifies ""themes."""	0
A dramatic comedy, as pleasantly dishonest and patting as any Hollywood fluff.	0
The cameo-crammed m: i-2 spoofing title sequence is the funniest 5-minute series of this agent comedy.   Then microphones pop up and ruin everything.	0
It's so silly that you wouldn't be surprised if Ba, Murdock and the rest of the A-team were seen in a black and red van during a car chase.	0
The 50 or so lovebirds are too immature and unattractive to care about.	0
Ingenious as the imagination is, this is one of those rare images that one searches for throughout, in the fervent hope that the rich promise of the script will be realised on screen. It never is, not completely.	0
Even in the summer, the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise opportunities.	0
which, with all the sweeping statements and rudeness about vanity, the worries of the rich and the sudden wisdom, makes the film a sermon most of the time.	0
A lousy film.	0
As playful as the film tries to make sense of its title character, there remains a huge gap between the creepy, neatly cut Dahmer (Jeremy Renner) and devilish plots that no serious textbook psychology can bridge.	0

It sits back and offers next to no insight into its fascinating subject.	0
I found myself increasingly frustrated and distanced, while my beliefs became increasingly odious.	0

Fear pervades the entire narrative, often comic but ultimately cowardly autocriticism.	0
The power struggles between victims and predators fit into an undifferentiated rhythm of artificial tension.	0
Absolutely awful.	0
The Ice Age treads predictably familiar ground, making the film a passable family film that won't win many fans age 12 and up.	0
Although the film is well intentioned, you could rent the original and get the same love story and parable.	0
too stupid and secondary to catch its target audience.	0
"The video work is so grainy and rough, so dependent on being ""naturalistic,"" rather than carefully lit and set up, that it is exhausting to watch."	0
Really awful.	0
a cleverly designed but ultimately hollow dummy.	0
Before it gets to the really good stuff, it gets tangled up in short-winded humour.	0

Bigelow manages the sequences of the nuclear crisis evenly, but softens the drama when it builds tension, dragging out too many scenes toward the end that should go fast.	0
There is undeniable joy in films crammed with movie references, but the fun wears off - unless otherwise.	0

It's an 88-minute highlight reel that's 86 minutes too long.	0
The film prefers the scientific to the spectacular (visually).	0
Such an incomprehensible mess that it feels less like bad cinema than like a nightmare about bad cinema stuck in a dark pit.	0

A bogus construct based on theory, sleight of hand and bad hypotheses.	0

Gooding offers a desperately unappealing performance.	0
Parker's new approach to familiar material is commendable, but his determination to remain true to the original text takes him to a slightly mannered tone.   which ultimately clouds the human tragedy at the heart of the story.	0

The film can be depressing about life itself.	0
I am sure the filmmakers found this a remarkable and novel concept, but anyone who has ever seen an independent film can report that it is a cheap cliche instead.	0
the acting is fine, but the script is about as interesting as a recording of conversations at the Wal-Mart checkout.	0
The weighty themes are too serious for teenagers, but the story is too steeped in fairy tales and other childish things to appeal to teenagers.	0
The plot falls into a comedy graveyard before Jane rushes to the rescue in the final role.	0
Sometimes there are very, very good reasons why certain films are sealed in a jar and put on a distant shelf indefinitely.	0
At 90 minutes, this film is short, but feels much longer.	0
Here's my advice, kev. Read your scripts before signing this dashed line.	0

An ugly, horrible story told so hideously and clumsily feels random.	0
Unfortunately, it's not good either. especially compared to the television series that inspired the film.	0
It wraps a classic mother-daughter battle in recycled paper with a shiny new ribbon, and while the audience realizes it's not all new, at least it looks pretty.	0
glazed with a tasty B-movie scum.	0
This is the kind of film in which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you, on your cluelessness, on your idiocy, on your completely misplaced seriousness.	0
It moves in many directions, looking (in vain, I think) for something fresh.	0
All in all, the path to ruin is more in love with foreignness than excellence.	0
A big fat pain.	0
a mimetic approach to better films such as Contempt and 8 1 / 2	0
Incomprehensible, poorly played, insanely bad, the Harvest Man is ridiculous enough to become a cult classic.	0
Watching the Powerpuff Girls movie, one anecdote kept coming to mind: the cartoon in Japan that gave people fits.	0
A missed opportunity.	0
An inelegant combination of two independent short films, which lags far behind the previous work of the director in terms of content and narrative.	0
Building a feel-good fantasy around a vain dictator-maniac is daunting to say the least, not to mention inappropriate and completely undeserved.	0
With the cheesiest monsters on either side of a horror parody that they are not, they are more likely to induce sleep than fear.	0
Mild, meandering teen movie.	0
Although its atmosphere is fascinating.   The drama is too predictable to make a big impression.	0
Although this crude and crude film does bring out a few laughs, its digs at modern society are all we have seen.	0
Although it is trying to be much more, it is really just another big league.	0
Amazing is not the word - nor is it incompetent, incoherent or just plain rubbish. In fact, none of these words really gets close to the particular kind of viciousness that is Deuces Wild.	0
One thing is for sure: this film doesn't tell much about Lily chou-chou.	0
With a tone as variable as cinematography, Schäffer's film never succumbs to the light-footed enchantment that the material needs, and the quirks and pitfalls of the characters never spread charm.	0
To understand better why this has not been associated with me, I would have to look at it again and I no longer sit through it.   That alone is enough.	0

Some of the computer animation is good-looking, and various amusing sidekicks give the otherwise dark story a much-needed lightness, but overall the film never gets beyond mediocrity.	0
There is an excellent 90-minute film here, which unfortunately takes 170 minutes.	0
As with saccharin films, it is likely that this leads to a massive cardiac arrest when taken in high doses.	0
Dying another day is only occasionally entertaining, but it's hard not to be a sucker for its charms, or perhaps it's just impossible not to feel nostalgic for movies you grew up with.	0

It's honest to a fault, but unfortunately not very convincing or funny.	0
Despite his distinctive screen presence, Jones is simply unable to deliver a film that, despite its title, should have been much more vicious if he wanted to make full use of the specific skills of its leading actors.	0
This sequel seems so similar to the 1953 Disney classic that you long for a geriatric Peter.	0
Why, you may ask, should you buy the film Milk when the TV cow is free? there is no good answer.	0
This slow-moving Swedish film doesn't even offer a hint of joy, preferring to focus on the humiliation of Martin, who gets rid of himself in bed and urinates on the plants at his own birthday party.	0

There is nothing more frustrating for a film buff than seeing an otherwise good film marred by a catastrophic ending.	0
It won't hurt anyone, but I can't think of a very good reason to rush off and see it. After all, it will probably be in video stores by Christmas, and it might just be better suited for a night in the living room than a night at the cinema.	0

If you spend too much time looking at the looseness of the play, the picture begins to resemble the shapeless, gripping acting workshop it is.	0

"It's a very tasteful rock ""n"" roll movie. You could put it anywhere on the coffee table."	0
The film is full of good intentions, but in its eagerness to squeeze the plot and our emotions into the all-too familiar dramatic arc of Holocaust escape, Minac draws on his individuality.	0

wendigo wants to be a monster film for the audience at the Kunsthaus, but it falls into the trap of prevention almost every time.	0
Bigelow offers some flashy twists and turns that occasionally amplify this murky fable. But the weight of water turns out to be largely a myopic mystery of time change, stuck in its lackluster gear of emotional bluntness.	0
This movie? No laughs.	0
A far from convincing documentary about a Yiddish theatre clan.	0
"The fact that the Chuck Norris ""grenade gag"" occurs about seven times during wind chats is a good indication of how serious the film is."	0
Viewers are so often asked to give up the belief that the film would be a total flop without Holm's performance.	0
It's not necessarily worth the money to spend the full price on a date, but when it comes out on video, it's worth the rent.	0
I can't begin to tell you how tiring, how decidedly unfunny, how thoroughly unrewarding it all is and what a reckless waste of four good acting talent.	0
everyone loves a david and goliath story, and it is told almost exclusively from david's perspective.	0
Get off the train!	0
There will be a showdown at some point, but by then the senses are as soggy as peas and you don't care who fires the shot.	0
irwin and his director never find a good reason why we should pay money for what we get for free on TV.	0
A light, gripping comedy that, with a crucial miscalculation in Act III, gambles away almost all of its accumulated pleasure.	0
Cedar wood defuses this provocative theme somewhat by immersing it in a grey love triangle.	0
To paraphrase a line from another Dickens novel, Nicholas Nickleby is too much like a fragment of an understated potato.	0
The actresses may have worked out a back story for the women they portray so convincingly, but viewers don't get enough of that backdrop for the characters to be involved as individuals, not types.	0
The result, however well-intentioned, is ironically exactly the kind of throwaway homage from the kitchen sink that illustrates why it is so often less than the sum of its parts in Hollywood today.	0
An extremely unpleasant film.	0
A film only for Friday fans, critics be damned. If you like something like that, that's fine.	0
a sincere but dramatically conflicted gay coming-of-age story.	0
Wait until it hits cable.	0
Ultimately, it feels like another film in the long line of films this year about filmmaking.	0
A high-minded snoozer.	0
Nothing but one relentlessly depressing situation after another throughout their entire lives, something to deal with right now in life.	0
77 minutes of Pokemon may not last forever, it just seems. My only wish is that celebs take me back to a time before I saw this movie and I could just skip it.	0
The only not so small problem with the expectation is that the whole exercise has no real meaning.	0
a film to watch rather than one to enter.	0
Moore is a real charmer.	0
john carlen's script is full of unhappy, two-dimensional characters who are far from convincing.	0
The film, which is based on the novel, cannot avoid a fatal flaw in modernity: it has transformed the male academic from an underclass Brit to an American, a choice that upsets the novel's exquisite balance and shreds the film's substance.	0
The idea of erasing emotions from people is so insanely dysfunctional, even in an advanced process nation, that the wildly devised equilibrium becomes a concept for us.	0
Stale first act, Scrooge story, blatant product placement, some very good comedic songs, strong finish, silly farts.	0
Unsurprisingly, the way it all works makes women look more like stereotypical janitors and moral teachers than competitive athletes.	0
A film that loses sight of its own story.	0
The eight crazy nights of the ladies sandler come upon you like a rash.	0
the Scooby on the big screen makes the silly original cartoon appear clever and well made.	0
Few of the increasingly far-fetched events that first-time writer-director Neil Burger pursues are terribly convincing, which is a shame considering Barry's superb performance.	0
will get better after the keeper leaves this small room.	0
The film is as padded as the belly.	0
Domestic evil is less a product of its cinematic predecessors than an MTV, a sugar hysteria, and a playstation cocktail.	0
A rather average action movie that benefits from some funny moments that epps provides.	0
Unspeakable, unbearably boring, with innumerable flat-out dialogue and a heroine who seems both shallow and witless.	0
resembles a soft porn brian de palma pastiche.	0
bluto blutarsky, we miss you	0
harmless enough to make even Jean-claude van damme look good.	0
It's a glorified sitcom, and a long, unfunny one at that.	0
Woody Allen can write and deliver a one-line like anyone else. But I had a lot of problems with this movie.	0
Untenable.	0
free of all the qualities that made the first film so special.	0
The seaside town varies from one approach to the other throughout the film, but in the end it sticks to the formula -- which is a waste of de niro, mcdormand and the other good cast members.	0
The plotless collection of idiotic stunts is by far the worst film of the year.	0
As sincere as it may be, the ascent never fully justifies its own existence.	0
Parker updates the scene in an attempt to make the film relevant today without fully understanding what made the story relevant in the first place.	0
It's a 21st-century morality game with a Latino hip hop beat. But the second half of the film really goes downhill.	0
Paxton's uneven directorial debut fails to unleash the full potential of this genre, which is fresh and dramatically substantial in many ways.	0
The script becomes lifeless and crumbles like a cheap lawn chair.	0
The script uses too many tried-and-tested tricks to distinguish it from the next teen comedy.	0
The film begins promisingly, but the ending is all too predictable and far too clichéd to work.	0
Let us put in place a moratorium that takes effect immediately, on tricky films about inspirational preschool teachers and the children they so warmly motivate.	0
It is the element of condescension that makes sex with strangers, which opens today in the New York metropolitan area, so distasteful when the filmmakers look down from their lofty perch on their working-class subjects.	0
By turns frustrating and rewarding.	0
It is impossible to classify this as even dirty guilt.	0
Despite his humorous failure, the man who wrote Rock does not deserve to sail with such a leaking ship.	0
Swinging, it seems in the film, is not a hobby that attracts young and fit people. Or smart.	0
The most memorable moment was when Green threw medical equipment at a window; not because it was particularly funny, but because I had a serious urge to grab the old lady at the end of the walkway and throw her on the screen in frustration.	0
See if you have nothing better to do with it. But be warned, you too may feel that time stands still. or that the battery of your watch is dead.	0
Too much familiarity suffers as hip British filmmakers ruthlessly strip away the Monty formula since 1997.	0
There are enough throwaway references to faith and rainbows to put smiling faces on that section of the population who took a walk to remember a niche hit.	0
"Yes, I gave this film a zero rating. But fans of the show shouldn't consider that nonsense. Think of it as ""perfection."""	0
the cumulative effect of the film is repulsive and depressing	0
Children and adults who love Pokemon will not be disappointed.	0
I don't care that there's no plot in this Antonio Banderas Lucy Liu faceoff. It's still terrible!	0
Though well dressed and well made, the children of the century end up falling prey to the contradiction that afflicts so many films about writers.	0
It's less a movie and more a joint advertisement for the National Basketball Association and teenage rap and teenage poster boy lil'bow wow.	0
Peralta's myth could have had an informed, grown-up background in retrospect.	0
Amazingly stupid.	0
A near-solid spy thriller with the misfortune of being published a few decades late.	0
disguises a familiar anti-feminist equation (career - children = misery) into annoying romantic-comedy duds.	0
The Good Girl is a film in which the talent is undeniable, but the results are terrifying.	0
Just a collection of this and that - whatever time fills - without a uniform whole.	0
The animation and gaming phenomenon, which peaked about three years ago, is actually dying a slow death, if the poor quality of Pokemon 4 is any indication.	0
Just about as sexy and dangerous as an actress in a role that resembles Elizabeth Berkley's flopping dolphin instinct at every opportunity	0
Children who are interested in this thorny berry-like stuff will probably be in Wedgie heaven. Anyone else who for any reason is thinking of watching this film is hereby warned.	0
Lord. Soderbergh's direction and visual style struck me as unusual and unimpressively picky and demanding.	0
"Say ""hello"" to your loved one when you wake up in the morning?"	0
It makes me feel weird / when I think of all the bad things in the world / like puppies with broken legs / and butterflies dying / and movies with pop queen	0
Director Tom Dey showed in his charming debut in Shanghai in 2000 a knack for mixing action and idiosyncratic humor, but the uninspired spread of TV cop show clichés usually leaves him empty handed.	0
Banal and predictable.	0
"""Yes, that's right: it's forest, angel of death."""	0
A wildly erratic drama with sequences that make one wince with embarrassment and others that are very touching thanks to the actors.	0
Though it's easier to sit through than most of Jaglom's confident and thankfully irritating films, it's still fraught with clichés, painful improbabilities and dark points.	0
I would imagine that finding a quarter in a huge pile of elephant droppings is about as pleasant as it gets.   It's downright awful.	0
a generic international version of a typical American horror film	0
Though clever in some places, this too-long, nonsensical update of Shakespeare's Macbeth does not sustain enough inventiveness.	0
Critical indeed.	0
Lucas is actually closer to the cheap, graceful and hackneyed sci-fi series of the 30s and 40s than anyone could wish for.	0
There is a lot of good material here, but also a lot of redundancy and unsuccessful rawness.	0
Absurdities and clichés pile up like lint in the belly button of a fat man.	0
If you think it's a riot when you see a young woman rob Schneider, then you'll enjoy the hot chick.	0
The sheer stupidity of the plot (apart from its one good idea) and the inevitable whiff of sleaziness bring you down.	0
Strangely, the kingdom is proving milder than wild.	0
The next big thing is his less big (and less hot) directorial debut.	0
"Another repetition of what has become one of the film's scariest conventions, in which the developmentally handicapped are portrayed with almost supernatural powers to humiliate, teach, and ultimately save their mentally ""superior"" friends and family."	0
Bond inspired? Sure. Will there be decades as a classic film series? Let's hope not.	0
This flat run on a hip-hop tootsie is so slow you could put the whole pootie tang between the punchlines.	0
Davis has energy, but she doesn't bother to make her heroine's book sound convincing, the ideas of gender warfare original or the comic scenes fly.	0
Surprisingly, given that Baird is a former film editor, the film is pretty choppy.	0
None of this is particularly original or funny.	0
A bland murder on campus yawns.	0
a humourless journey into a philosophical void	0
These two produce about as much chemistry as an Iraqi factory willing to get an inspector.	0
responsável direto pelo fracasso 'artístico' de doce lar, o roteirista c. jay cox não consegue sequer aproveitar os pouquíssimos momentos em que escapa da mediocridade.	0
Just as the lousy Tarantino imitations have subsided, comes the first lousy guy Ritchie imitation.	0
A passable romantic comedy that needs a few more runs through the word processor.	0
The film tries to elicit laughs from a genre - gangster / crime comedy - that lost its appeal with audiences a few years ago, and its cute dependence on film-specific clichés is not exactly endearing.	0
shows that Holmes has the screen presence to become a major league leader, (but) the film itself is an underachiever, a psychological mystery that brings its sweet timeline to a climax that hardly comes as a surprise on arrival.	0
"In the market for book on tape, the film ""Das Kind bleibt im Bild"" would be an abridged edition"	0
Ultimately.   The film is too exhilarating for children and too preachy for adults.	0
It's just a bit too complacent.	0
Clever, but not particularly convincing.	0
mckay seems embarrassed by his own invention and tries to rush through the passages, apparently hoping that the audience will not notice the blatant banality of the plot device he uses.	0
A piece of mildly entertaining, harmless fluff that drifts aimlessly for 90 minutes before nestling into the cracks of this ever-growing category: unembarrassing but unmemorable.	0
Labute was more fun when his characters tortured each other psychologically and spoke publicly about their genitals.	0
The film weighs no more than a glass of champagne.	0
Brilliant hack.	0
the problem with antwone fisher is that it has a screenplay by antwone fisher based on the book by antwone fisher.	0
Alarms for Duvall's throbbing sincerity and his old tendency to pat people as he speaks.	0
The maudlin way in which the story unfolds suggests a director who fights against the urge to sensationalise his subject matter.	0
What Rifkin's story of the precarious dignity of skidding achieves in grace is marginalized by predictable conspiracies and tedious historiography.	0
tries to function in the same way as the brilliance of Animal House, but instead approaches the failure of the third revenge of the nerds.	0
"Unfortunately, kapur modernizes one.   Mason's story fits the sensibilities of a young American, a decision that exposes ""the four feathers."""	0
What a banal bore the preaching circuit is	0
Untruths are piling up, undermining the reality of the film and suppressing its creator's comic voice.	0
A mechanical action comedy whose ostensible purpose is to sell the charismatic Jackie Chan to a younger audience.	0
one of the most contradictory features of recent history.	0
Low rent from frame one.	0
Eight-legged freaks? Not a big hairy affair.	0
The themes are presented so miserably, with some of the (unintentionally) funniest moments of the year, that you can't care.	0
"The stragglers ""drama becomes an uninspired philosophical revelation."	0
Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant's respective charms have worn off.	0
"""This film sucks."""	0
None of these so-called satires have a sting in the flesh, as if Woody is afraid to bite the hand that has finally warmed up somewhat.	0
bibbidy-bobbidi-fad.	0
Some non-believers may reconsider their attitudes when they see the joy the characters feel in this creed, but skeptics are unlikely to go to theater.	0
Bad in such a bizarre way that it is almost worth seeing, if only to witness the crazy interplay of sense and taste.	0
There's more repetition than creativity in the entire film.	0
Hugh Grant's act is so elaborate that it's sometimes hard to tell who the other actors in the film are.	0
Although the sequel has all the outer elements of the original, the sweet scaliness of the first film has disappeared and is replaced by the forced merriment found in the most boring children's films.	0
I had more interesting - and, dare I say, thematically more complex - bowel movements than this conventional point-and-shoot exercise in a sophisticated thriller.	0
what we get.   is a caddy hack that is crossed with the faithful order of raccoons.	0
The jokes are flat and the plot seems fake.	0
If a film asks you to take pity on Mick Jagger's sex life, you've already done it.	0
There are now two signs that this is happening. Shyamalan's feature debut absorbed everything he had to give to the mystical genres of cinema: unbreakable and characters.	0
Hokey Art House.	0
a weak and ineffective ghost story without conclusion or success.	0
The film is overloaded with so many distracting special effects and visual party tricks that it's not clear whether to scream or laugh.	0
The picture is dark, poorly written, opaque and poorly staged, as if everyone who shot it had lost their movie mojo.	0
This is a missed opportunity of gigantic proportions - a lunar mission without signs of life.	0
a mysterious subplot about drug smuggling inside Danish cows falls flat, and if you want to change the ending of the Bard, you better have a good alternative.	0
Soderbergh seems only capable of delivering artfully illuminated, serious research that lacks the kind of real depth it would deliver.	0
The only thing that distinguishes a Randall-Wallace film from any other is the fact that there is no difference in a Randall-Wallace film.	0
Stupid stuff, all jumbled up like a work by a child who can't quite tell one science fiction work from another.	0
There is so much deceptive sensibility.	0
The city has a kind of authentic flair, but each of these people stands out and everyone else is in the background, and it just seems artificial and manufactured.	0
too juicy for his own good.	0
Circuit queens won't learn anything, they'll be too busy insulting the film's strategically placed white sheets.	0
As an actress, Madonna is one of the helluva singers. When the Mediterranean sparkles, it sinks.	0
Again and again, a film comes along that is so insanely stupid, so terrible in so many ways, that you get dizzy. Half dead is such an achievement.	0
Although the film has been extended to 65 minutes for theatrical release, it still feels somewhat unfinished.	0
It all looks like a $40 million version of a game you'd rather enjoy on a computer.	0
[javier bardem] is one of the few reasons to see the film, which director Gerardo Vera has impregnated with vibrant music and feverish melodrama.	0
feels flashy, simple and soapy.	0
adults, other than the parents.   will have a hard time heeding the call of the wild.	0
Brady manages the remarkable feat of squandering a first-class four.   by pushing them into every conceivable clichéd white-trash situation.	0
In the name of a supposedly inspiring and easily marketable film, the Imperial Club turns a blind eye to the very history it claims to teach.	0
No amount of blood and crumbling vampire carcasses can disguise the film's lack of ideas.	0
A publication that leads directly to nothing.	0
Typical anime with cheap animations (like Saturday morning television in the 1960s), a complex sword-and-witchcraft plot and characters with big round eyes and Japanese names.	0
Below expectations.	0
At no point during k-19: the widower, this viewer felt enmeshed in a story that, while universal in its themes of loyalty, courage and devotion to a common goal, never seems to leave the lot.	0
Standard guns versus martial arts clichés with little new.	0
The Empire cannot decide whether it wants to be a gangster movie or an art film. It doesn't work either.	0
Since virtually no one has to go to the theatre for this, the project should have been made for the tube.	0
Possession is an honourable, interesting failure in the end. It lags far behind poetry, but it's not bad prose.	0
Jonathan Parker's Bartleby should have been the be-all and end-all of modern office anomie films.	0
"There may have been a good film in ""Trouble Every Day,"" but it's not what's on the screen."	0
Unfortunately, Carson's rubber-faced routine is not up to the task of writing the grim screenplay with Harris Goldberg.	0
There is nothing remotely triumphant about this film, whether it be comedy, romance, fairy tale or drama.	0
Given the old-fashioned plot and the pornographic way in which the film revels in maternity homes, dresses and parties, there's something unintentionally funny about the bang on authenticity.	0
"The master of disguise is funny - not ""ha ha"" funny, ""dead circus performer"" funny. and for all the wrong reasons."	0
96 minutes of mediocre special effects, grey dialogue, flowing accents and - worst of all - silly looking morlocks.	0
A 75-minute rehearsal of childish rubbish that is listless, witless and lacking in any sense of humour.	0
You leave the workout with the feeling of having done a long workout without your pulse ever racing.	0
The waterlogged script plumbs unexplored depths of stupidity, incoherence and subsexuality.	0
With mcconaughey in a totally irony-free zone and pads largely confined to twitching sensitive eyelids, there is a lack of intelligence, wit or innovation on screen to attract and entertain older audiences.	0
It's the kind of stunt the Academy loves: a powerful political message packed into an otherwise mediocre film.	0
In theory, a middle-aged romance linking Clayburgh and Tambor sounds promising, but in practice it's something else entirely - clownesque and insulting and nothing like real life.	0
So numbingly awful, you'd hope Britney wouldn't do it again for movies.	0
The images are usually shortened in favor of soggy obviousness and telegraphed pathos, especially when it comes to Whitaker's inappropriate artists.	0
If Welles were unhappy at the prospect of humanity splitting in two, he probably wouldn't be too mad if his great-grandson's film split in much the same way.	0
sets animations back 30 years, musicals back 40 years and Judaism back at least 50.	0
Strangely, Besenfeld has compelling new material, but he only reveals it at the end, after endless scenes in which he tortures reluctant witnesses and directs his camera through the smeared windshield of his rental car.	0
best as a day instructor.	0
Finally, it reaches her heart as simple self-reflection.	0
The film, which portrays both the scenic splendour of the mountains and the legendary actor Michel Serrault, is less successful on another level.	0
Boy, oh boy, it's a howl.	0
A few parts of the film whirr and whirr, very little of it clicks. It just doesn't get going.	0
contains few laughs and even fewer surprises.	0
The actors must indeed be good at reciting some of these ridiculous dialogue with a straight face.	0
Most storylines feel like time-filler between surf shots. The film isn't terrible, but you see mediocre waves on the next wave.	0
As old-fashioned as the material is, Lawrence's delivery remains perfect; his great gift is that he can actually make you think something of this worn, pandering palaver is funny.	0
There is nothing remotely current or sexist about it.	0
"The tuxedo was not only bad, but, as my friend David Cross would call it, ""hungry servings bad."""	0
Blue Crush is so long and boring that it's not even remotely the bad movie it promised.	0
The sequel plays like a flimsy excuse to give Blade fans another look at Wesley Snipe's iconic hero battling dozens of villains at once.	0
While Van Wilder may not be the worst national Lampoon film, he is far from the animal shelter of this generation.	0
so devoid of lust and sensuality that one cannot even call it hedonistic.	0
It smacks of rotting and chopping from start to finish.	0
A tiring family drama about a porcelain empire and as tough as its fabric.	0
woody allen has really found his groove these days. The problem is that it allows him to release one mediocre film after another.	0
the bland weighs more heavily than the fine, and cletis tout never becomes the clever crime comedy it is.	0
It is such a mechanical endeavor that it never bothers to question why anyone spends time on it.	0
The artistic direction is often exquisite and the anthropomorphic animal figures are beautifully executed by clever make-up design, so one can hope that the later release on DVD will feature subtitles and the original Italian soundtrack.	0
If you like the predictability of bland comfort food, then the film is pleasant enough.	0
In the end, the history of the Academy may make you wonder what jazz was about in 2002. Cellweger's tearful pout and spindly attempt at a genial role make her Best Actress nomination even more compelling.	0
A really bad film with a badly distorted logic by writer and director Kurt Wimmer.	0
a pleasant and engaging session, but when trying to have the best of both worlds, it falls behind the whole.	0
Plot and animation offer daytime television, but little more.	0
is a tired, unimaginative and derivative variant of this already shallow genre.	0
In short, human nature is not nearly as funny as it thinks, and not nearly as intelligent.	0
A film with a great premise, but only one great premise.	0
Instead of becoming a laugh spasm, we are left with a handful of disparate funny moments with no real consequences.	0
Kirshner and Monroe seem to be in a contest about who can outwit the other. (Kirshner wins, but it's close.)	0
A lame romantic comedy about an unlikeable character and someone who probably wouldn't be so stupid as to get involved.	0
What began as a tight contest of wills between Bacon and Theron degenerates into a protracted and borderline stupid chase.	0
[Sam's] self-flagellation is depressing rather than entertaining.	0
An ugly, senseless, stupid film.	0
Simply put, there should have been a more convincing excuse to pair Susan Sarandon and Goldie Hawn.	0
The Master of Disguise is Adam Sandler's latest attempt to dumb down the universe.	0
This is a clumsy film, ill-fitting, with its elbows sticking out where knees should be.	0
Too stupid to take it seriously.	0
the inevitable double and triple crosses arise, but the only drama is waiting to hear the reedy consigliere of john malkovich utter his next line.	0
Everything is serious, poetic, serious and - unfortunately - boring.	0
I like it. No, I hate it. No, I love it.   I don't know.	0
This mess of a film is nothing less than a travesty of a transvestite comedy.	0
It is crammed with heavy-handed symbolism, dime-store psychology and endless scenes that make 105 minutes seem twice as long.	0
Fifty car clichés.	0
It is a stale, over-used cocktail that has been using the same olives as garnish since 1962. Not only is it the worst of the bunch, but it's also one of the worst of the franchise.	0
What ultimately makes Windtalkers a disappointment is the superficial way they handle their history.	0
Hart's War can only be recommended as a showpiece, even if the best-paid Willis is not the most impressive. As a story of dramatic enlightenment, the screenplay by Billy Ray and Terry George leaves much to be desired.	0
A non-British woman could survive a performance without much damage, except perhaps in the last 15 minutes, which are as maudlin as you can imagine after school.	0
It's not hateful. It's just stupid, irrelevant and deeply, truly, bottomlessly cynical	0
Perhaps not since grumpy old men have I heard a film so firmly tied to one demographic while arguing with another.	0
The drama was so uninspiring that even a story steeped in love, lust and sin could not capture my attention.	0
A pretty tired exercise in nostalgia.	0
The misery of these people becomes another voyeuristic spectacle to be consumed and forgotten.	0
Some bodies often look like an episode of the TV show's blind date, just less technically savvy and without pop-up comments.	0
Bad Company has one of the stupidest scripts of the year, full of holes that are obvious even to those who don't seek them.	0
Predecessors are intellectual masterpieces alongside the Scorpio King.	0
The city is a decidedly inactive film, bordering on confessional.	0
While the children are likely to devour it, most adults are way ahead of the action.	0
One-sidedness.   flirts with propaganda.	0
Despite an impressive list of stars and directed by Kathryn Bigelow, the weight of water is oppressive.	0
We liked Klein's other work, but the rollerball left us cold.	0
They were afraid to show the film to critics before the opening, fearing the bad reviews they thought they deserved. They were right.	0
It would be petty to begrudge anyone any comfort they can find in Dragonfly, but it is impossible to find the film as anything other than appalling, shamelessly manipulative and constructed and utterly unconvincing.	0
offers no new insights into this matter, nor do its characters come to life.	0
"nohe has made a decent ""intro"" documentary, but he feels like a spectator, not a participant."	0
It may seem to be conceived as a reverie about remembrance and regret, but the only thing you will regret is remembering the experience, living it.	0
A 94-minute travesty of unprecedented proportions, writer-director Parker seems to be doing everything in his power to transform the classic false identity farce of the legendary joke into brutally edited and unfunny hokum.	0
Guy becomes girl, guy loses girl, audience falls asleep	0
Too common to bring [harmlessly] back to the fore, despite some creepy scenes that evoke childish nighttime horrors and a commendable attempt to create tension rather than overwhelm the audience.	0
stirs potentially tantalizing ingredients into an uneasy mix of spirit and close encounters of the third kind.	0
The strange thing about Clause 2, supposedly a children's film, is that it contains nothing that emotionally involves children.	0
It is arrogant in a way that borders on amateurish.	0
contains the humor, characterization, conciseness and intelligence of a bad sitcom	0
It doesn't matter that the film lasts less than 90 minutes. It still feels like a prison stretch.	0
Part schmaltzy, part romantic comedy, part shallow reflection on the emptiness of success - and utterly soulless.	0
ong decides to portray her life as a light, weightless fairy tale, the most unpleasant details of which melt away in the face of the character's sober optimism	0
"The overall feeling is not like watching a glorious episode of ""7th heaven."""	0
Just a kiss is a waste.	0
This is not even a film we can enjoy as mild escapism; it is one in which fear and frustration are provoked to intolerable levels.	0
Frankly, it's an insult of sorts to both men and women. And that's not funny - which is just generally offensive.	0
As if that were not enough, this equally mocking clown is fixated on the spectacle of small-town competition.	0
A wretched film that reduces the Second World War to a search for an old flame.	0
This is a remake of the numbers, combining a half-hearted plot with a series of standup routines in which Wilson and Murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious film.	0
it is better than the middle row steven seagal, but not as sharp as jet li on roller blades.	0
No dia em que aceitou conductor esta continuação, harold ramis deve ter saído da cama com o pé esquerdo e aqueles que decidiram assistir a este films também.	0
There is a reason why half-time is only 15 minutes long.	0
the talkative film plays like one of robert altman's smaller works	0
As jolly and vicious as his characters.	0
It was one of those films that started with a great premise and just fell apart.	0
A pretentious mess.	0
"Nothing better or worse than ""truth or consequences, n.  or any other interchangeable action is fraudulent mafia tool bags botching a routine task in a Western backwater"	0
A sour attempt to make the female set laugh in the style of a colourless brother.	0
[Macdowell] ventures beyond her abilities several times and shows how bad she is as an actress.	0
i can imagine this film as a b & w british comedy, around 1960, with Peter Sellers, Kenneth Williams and others. , but at this point, with this cast, this film is hopeless.	0
Chatty, artificial and opaque.   An interesting technical exercise, but a tiring picture.	0
Kurys never shows why Sand and Musset deserve special attention out of all the fleeting romantic lives of the time.	0
Almost nothing else - however impetuous and vivid it may be in the presentation - is one-sided, outwardly sexist or mean. And in a way, it's a burden.	0
It's easy to love Robin Tunney - she's pretty and she can act - but it's getting harder and harder to understand her choices.	0
If you have a house full of shreds - don't worry, it will be on video long before they grow up and you can wait until then.	0
"the new film by anton chekhov's the cherry obstard puts the ""ick"" in ""classic."""	0
has a lively musical beat to which you can dance, but its energy cannot be compared to the wit, humour and snappy dialogue of the original. If I want music, I buy the soundtrack. If I want a real movie, I buy the DVD.	0
An unobtrusive, modern action / comedy buddy film whose only nostalgic note is in the title.	0
has all the right elements, but completely fails to fit together.	0
"Screenwriter and director Steven Gaghan has made the near fatal mistake of being what the English call ""half too clever."""	0

The end result is like cold porridge with only one or two pleasantly tough lumps.	0
For all the charm of Kevin Kline and a story that examines old-fashioned values, there is something creepy about this film.	0
I felt this film until it veered too far into the Exxon zone, leaving me at the station in search of a return ticket to realism.	0
"Producer John Penotti interviewed students.   And came back with the astonishing revelation that ""they wanted to see something that didn't speak to them."" Ignoring that, he made a swimmer"	0
Naive fans might be disappointed. Those who do not know the work of the author, however, can quickly fall asleep.	0
Hoffman waits too long to turn his film in an unexpected direction, and even then his tone retains a posh prep school quality that feels dusty and leather-bound.	0
"If you're a crocodile hunter, you'll at least enjoy the ""real"" parts of the film. If you're looking for a story, don't worry."	0
Full frontal had no effect and elicited no sympathy from any of the characters. By that standard, it's a failure.	0
is an amazing mixture of gritty realism and magical realism with a difficult to swallow premise.	0
An affable but malnourished romantic comedy that can't keep up with the freshness of the earlier collaboration between actress, producer and writer.	0
Sometimes that modest number clicks, sometimes not.	0
like a pack of dynamite rods built for controversy. The film is explosive, but some of these canes are wet.	0
has its charming quirks and its dreary spots.	0
Evans, a self-confessed egomaniac, is no Hollywood villain, yet you almost wish he'd gone the way of Don Simpson.	0
The audience, when I saw it, laughed at the wrong time, and that's a bad sign when they're supposed to have a collective heart attack.	0
Everyone is to blame.	0
You get the impression that writer and director Burr knows the territory.   But his sense of humour has not lost the smug complacency that is normally associated with better private schools.	0
less a study of madness or love than a study of schoolgirl delusion.	0
Rice never clearly defines his characters and gives us no reason to care about them.	0
It's a bizarre curiosity, especially memorable because it mixes its potentially interesting material with a banal script, unspectacular acting and indifferent direction.	0
An easy and obvious effort, even for a target group whose demographic development is probably still in the single digits due to age.	0
Sex with strangers will shock many with its blunt candour. But what is missing is morality. What are the filmmakers about? Why did they feel it necessary to document all this emotional misery?	0
You see Robin Williams and psycho killers and you think, hmmm. You see the film and you think, zzzzzzzzz.	0
"The script's endless attack on embarrassingly shameless sex jokes, which smack of a recast designed to give the film a ""cooler"" rating, is almost transparent."	0
The film slips as macho action conventions prevail.	0
Formulas of 51. Power, rather like this.	0
Dragqueen 'on Dragons	0
"Howard and his co-stars all give engaging performances, but they are often thwarted by Howard's confident attempts to find a ""literary"" film style that suits his theme."	0
A respectable but uninspired thriller, intelligent and thoughtful in its details, but ultimately weak in its impact.	0
Jones helps to breathe some life into the insubstantial plot, but even he is overwhelmed by predictability.	0
The film has just too much on its plate to really stay afloat during its barely ninety minutes of play.	0
comes across more as a crime, a flat, unconvincing drama that never catches fire	0
Film ready.	0
offers absolutely nothing I have not seen before.	0
"""Analyze that"" is one of those crass, invented sequels that not only fails in itself, but also suggests affection for the original at second sight."	0
One could say that Tykwer did everything heaven allows, if one wanted to make a pun on Antikyeslovian puns. It is only fair to say that their full promise remains somewhat unfulfilled.	0
Complex, sinuous and somehow repulsively cold.	0
First-time writer and director Dylan Kidd also has a good ear for dialogue, and the characters sound like real people.	0
An airless, pre-packaged Julia's would-be robber, who stinks so badly of hard-to-sell image editing that you wonder if the lopez publicist should share the script credit.	0
Gold member has none of the visual wit of previous images, and it looks like Jay cockroach steered the film from behind a taxi.	0
"You might as well have said ""under siege 3: at Alcatraz.""   A cinematic corpse that never comes alive."	0
Compared to his earlier films, it seems like a disappointingly thin slice of London's underclass life despite the title.   is surprisingly little.	0
lame sweet home leaves no southern stereotype untouched	0
Slow, dry, poorly cast, but beautifully shot.	0
The jokes are secondary, stereotypes are sprinkled everywhere and the acting ranges from bad to physical.	0
will provide hours of material for discussion among ministers and Bible study groups. But mainstream audiences will find little interest in this film, which is often preachy and poorly acted.	0
In his heart of hearts, the crush takes on absurd proportions to ignore the very problems it raises.	0
This long and relentlessly sacharistic film is a clear case of preaching to converts.	0
The film is flat.	0
But the film is a bumpy ride   It is at least observable.	0
"It's a boom box of a film that could be titled ""The Loud and the Ridiculous.""   the pandering to a cinema audience dominated by young men is too calculated."	0
An incredibly stupid film, but occasionally funny enough to make you forget its absurdity.	0
The first deadly attraction was vile enough. Do we really need the Tiger Strike version?	0
This Bond film is off the beaten track, not necessarily for the better	0
The problem is that the film has no idea whether it's serious or not.	0
When the fire burns out, we are dealing with only a few dragons, and that is where the film fails.	0
It would work much better than an hour-long TV documentary.	0
The elements were all there, but the lack of a pyschological centre flattens them out.	0
Anaemic chronicle of the money that robs New York and its loveless connections.	0
It just doesn't have enough weight to justify its two-hour playing time.	0
an unsuccessful attempt at an idea film.	0
Queen of the Damned, as you might have guessed, regrets the use of aaliyah in her only starring role - she does little here but point to things going up in flames.	0
This toothless dog, already sitting on the cable, loses every bite on the big screen.	0
It made me feel impure, and I'm the guy who liked that there was something about Mary and the two American pie movies. Oh, and spoil reputation.	0
Not only is it crazy, manipulative and as bland as a miracle bread dipped in milk, it does the very last thing Hollywood needs to do to us: preach.	0
It is so crammed with scenes and perspectives and beautiful moments that a few crucial things, such as character development and cohesion, are left out.	0
An eviction notice should be issued in every theatre where Sara is served.	0
Director Rob Mitchell gets so many of the little things right that it's hard not to punish him harshly for botching the big things.	0
"A loud, cheap and tired formula film that appears in the euphemism ""urban drama."""	0
The film has a wooden script (by Paul Pender) and is mercilessly folksy, a procession of staged set pieces stacked with binary contrasts.	0
A pathetic exploitative film that tries to appear sincere, and just seems worse for wear.	0
Eventually, all this visual trickery ceases to be clever, and lapses into shrill, vaguely silly overkill.	0
Despite its charm and heart, this quirky football import is unforgotten	0
"Meyjes ""film, like Max Romman's future, doesn't work."	0
What is so badly needed, but practically lacking here, is either a saving dark humour or a sense of poetic tragedy.	0
"Master tailor.   makin 'a fool of himself.   lose ""his fan base."	0
An ambitious, serious film that manages to do virtually everything wrong; it's something of an act of cinematic penance.	0
Not even remotely exciting.	0
A Frankenstein mish-mash that ranges from dark satire to cartoonish slapstick, Bartleby doesn't do either particularly well.	0
It plays like a large-scale extracurricular special with a generous cast, sometimes lifting the material out of its well-meaning dullness.	0
The quiet American has something not entirely convincing. and that goes for both the film and the title character played by Brandan Fraser.	0
One of those strained caper films that is hardly fun and begins to evaporate from memory minutes after its end.	0
a little less bling bling and a lot more romance.	0
The end is not working.   But most of the film works so well that I almost recommend it anyway -- maybe not to everyone, but certainly to people with a curiosity about how a movie can go very well and go wrong.	0
It's hard to believe these pranksters have committed four similar kidnappings.	0
I'm not quite sure what this film is about.	0
He is an uncomfortably shallow and immature character, which means you spend 110 claustrophobic minutes with him.	0
The tempo is so high that none of the outstanding performers can breathe.	0
The bottom line, at least in my opinion, is that a short story is better than a movie.	0
Some elements of it really blow the big one, but others are decent.	0
It's just a shame that the story of the film doesn't live up to its style.	0
"Unless you're a fanatic, the best advice is: ""Scooby"" is not."	0
a cautionary tale about the folly of superficiality, which is itself endlessly superficial	0
For single digit nidlets the small 2 is still no problem. If you want to rekindle the magic of the first movie, you need a stronger belly than us.	0
Shreve's graceful double narrative becomes clunky on screen, and we are repeatedly carried away by the compelling historical story into a less compelling soap opera.	0
contains a few big laughs, but many more that graze the funny bone or miss it altogether, partly because the deliberately dumb approach is thin.	0
Nothing more than an assembly-line widget to see if stupid Americans challenge stupid Brits with sweet accents, ancient slapstick and unfunny tricks.	0
This is a film tailored for those who, when they were in high school, preferred cliff-edge scores to reading a long classic.	0
The film is undone by a method of filmmaking that is experimental enough to alienate mainstream audiences, while being clichéd to die-hard indie minds.	0
A tangled fantasy comedy that lacked a coherent plot when it came to script, shooting or post-production.	0
A sad and audacious exercise in milking a cunning idea - a heterogeneous guy has to dress in drag - that shockingly is even worse than its title suggests.	0
The personal speed was supposed to explore the inner workings of these women, but it never moves beyond its surface.	0
We hate [Madonna] for the first five minutes of the film, and she lacks the skill or presence to make up ground.	0
[ahola] sounds like arnold schwarzenegger, with a physique that suits him, has a wooden delivery and encounters a considerable arc of change that does not produce any real transformation.	0
There are two big things missing - anything approaching a kick in the butt, and anything with even a vague reason to sit it out.	0
A fascinating but choppy documentary	0
Hardly worth mentioning, apart from the fact that there are reports of weeds blowing through the empty rooms.	0
The foofus-on-the-loose banter of the welcome to Collinwood has a swaggering, hour-long ramblings. And, as with most late-night bull sessions, the content is not nearly as compelling as the participants think.	0
Too staged, too talkative - and too long - for its own good.	0
apparently from the editing room of any day soap.	0
The dark inspiration that fueled Devito's early work is confused in death with something ugly and unspiritual.	0
Despite Auteuil's performance, it's a rather listless walk in the middle of the street, where the thematic irony is too obvious and the sexual politics too smug.	0
Director Boris von Sikowski opts instead for a routine slasher film, which was probably more fun than sitting through.	0
Little more than a well-acted TV melodrama shot for the big screen.	0
never come together into a coherent whole.	0
an unintentionally surreal image of children.   , in which actors in bad bear suits perform a kind of cross-species parody of a Vh1 behind the music episode.	0
First, a film that tries to be smart is somehow stupid. And second, what about all the shooting?	0
They don't even bother to rent it on video.	0
I guess there's something frontal about stunts and acting and how it distorts reality for people who make movies and watch them, but like most movie puzzles it only works if you're interested in the characters.	0
This is the kind of film that gets a quick release before real contenders arrive in September.	0
Quite apart from a few crass comedies I try to forget, this is the first film in a long time that got me to close the theatre in the first 10 minutes.	0
plays like a long, meandering sketch, inspired by the works of john waters and todd solondz, and not like a fully developed story.	0
The film lacks enough innovation or pizzazz to attract teenagers, and lacks the novel charm that made Spy Kids a surprise winner among both adults and younger viewers.	0
A quirky self-parody set like a strange masterpiece theatre sketch, without a standpoint or compelling reason.	0
To be an average B-movie without ambition anymore.	0
Barlett's hero remains a reactive cipher, if opening the man's head and heart is the only conceivable reason for the film.	0
Gibney and Jareki just want to tie up the bastard.	0
The plot is plastered with Hollywood cliché after Hollywood cliché, most of it about precocious children beating obnoxious adults.	0
Less the concern to cover all the drama in Frida's life, and more time spent exploring her process of turning pain into art, would have made this film superior.	0
A film that suffers from its many excesses.	0
Too bland and tasteless to be really prudish.	0
In any case, I would only recommend big bad love to wingers who have been missing since 1995. But even then I would recommend to wait for the DVD and jump directly to its scenes.	0
shows the saddest and dirtiest human behaviour on screen and then laughs at how clever it is.	0
"Nijinsky says, ""I know how to suffer,"" and when you see this film, you know it."	0
'One day, maybe, cq will be fondly remembered as the brief pretentious phase of the Coppola novel, before moving on to other films that tell a story worth considering	0
The only thing scary about feardotcom is that the filmmakers and the studio are brazen enough to dismiss this stinker as a horror movie.	0
Stale and uninspired.	0
A bleak film.	0
The story simply goes on, in search of astute observations, and goes on empty.	0
"Instead of inventing the death of a climate hero for the beloved main character, who is to remain nameless, why not invite a real spontaneity to the film by actually letting the evil aliens ""laser guns hit?"	0
It just didn't mean much to me and was too distorted to ever get a grip on (or be entertained by) it.	0
This action thriller / dark comedy is one of the most repellent things to emerge in a movie year already littered with celluloid rubbish.	0
mib ii is a film that allows the viewer to fall asleep for a few minutes or make several runs to the stand and / or the toilet and not feel as if they have missed something. This is because relatively nothing happens.	0
"No art theorist - the special effects are ""German-Expressionist,"" as the press releases say - can make it ridiculous."	0
Blue Crush follows the formula, but throws in too many conflicts to make the story compelling.	0
Boyd's screenplay (co-written with Guardian hack Nick Davies) has a flourishing twist that owes more to Guy Ritchie than the Bard.	0
There is no spark of new inspiration in it, just more of it, with much less energy and imagination.	0
Jackson strolls through the mess with a smug grin, inexplicably wearing a kilt and a bag of golf clubs over one shoulder.	0
a moving image that does not move.	0
Quiet-raw! Nothing is really right with this crack!	0
Its key points are simultaneously buried, drowned and suffocated in the excesses of writer-director Roger Avary.	0
I'm not sure these words have ever been summed up in one sentence: this erotic cannibalism is boring.	0
"""God help us, but Capra and cooper roll in their graves."""	0
An hour and a half of harmless, unmemorable filler.	0
Is it a comedy? A drama? A romance? A caricature?	0
If the film starts off so funny, it's nothing.	0
Did the film inform and clarify me? Yes. Was it interested in what happened in Armenia in 1915? No. And here Araat was wrong.	0
It's a bad sign in a thriller when you know someone instantly.	0
has its usual jovial character, but a lack of specious inventiveness.	0
Eight-legged freaks won't enter the pantheon of the big monster / sci-fi movies we love.	0
It finds the details of its time frame right, but it misses its emotions completely.	0
Who is actually fighting whom? Ah, yes, that would be me: fighting the urge to snooze.	0
A kilted jackson is a disturbing sight and indicative of his, if you will, out of control character wandering aimlessly through ill-conceived action pieces.	0
The film is constructed, clumsy and full of unintentional laughs, and shows signs that someone other than the director came into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the film faster.	0
begins with enormous promise and introduces a fascinating and seductive premise, only to fall victim to a shipload of script clichés that sink it faster than a leaking freighter.	0
The film too often lapses into sugar-sweet sentiments and holds back the implementation of the pyrotechnics that his punchy style promises.	0
is the only question.   is to determine how well the lard is produced - to judge the quality of the manipulative technique. At best, I'm scared.	0
This film is so bad that it is almost worth seeing because it is so bad.	0
A crisply shot film that is nothing more than slightly amusing.	0
This film feels more like a continuous cry for attention than an attempt at some satisfying entertainment.	0
Overall, it's a pretty mediocre family film.	0
Love may have been in the air on screen, but I felt none of it.	0
In addition to the exaggerated, clumsy direction, in which all the actors reach for the back row, the dialogues sound like terrible poetry.	0
"The very definition of what critics call ""ambitious failure."""	0
It's as if de Palma spent an hour setting a fancy table and then served powerful macaroni and cheese.	0
"The film ends with clips in which most of the characters forget their lines and just say ""uhhh,"" which is better than most of the lyrics written in the film."	0
Deserves the gong.	0
Though certainly more naturalistic than its Australian counterpart, Amari's film fails to build the drama of Lila's journey.	0
I found the film as divided against itself as the dysfunctional family it portrays.	0
The film's soulful serenity, though beautifully imbued with dry absurd wit, eventually becomes too heavy for the plot.	0
The film adds nothing fresh to the myth.	0
As inept as the Avengers and Wild West remakes on the big screen.	0
seems like a relic from a bygone era and its twists.   more silly than plausible.	0
moves in such strange directions and lapses into such news-worthy moralism that its good qualities are disguised.	0
It is a very sincere work, but it would be better than a diary or documentation.	0
Haneke's own sadistic tendencies towards his audience leave a sour taste in his mouth and little else.	0
Oops, she really did it this time. That chirpy songbird Britney Spears has emerged with more mindless fanfare.	0
It's a despicable film, it really is and it makes absolutely no sense.	0
a cooler that works resolutely without chills.	0
For those of us who react more to storytelling than to computer-generated effects, the new Star Wars episode has not escaped the trap dug by the last.	0
The director usually plays it straight and turns the fable into a listless climb up the social ladder.	0
"""Bad"" is the operative word for ""bad company,"" and I don't mean that well."	0
Although Frida is easier to swallow than Julie's absurd Titus, the eye candy lacks considerable brio.	0
Drumline is -- the mere, if visually compelling suggestion of a fully realized story.	0
The whole film is just a lazy exercise in bad filmmaking, asking you to expose not only your disbelief but your intelligence.	0
The film gives us fascinating insights into the insights we have gained from lifelong spiritual research, but this is not the case.	0
Pompous and confused.	0
Billy Crystal and Robert de Niro sleepwalk through vulgarities in a sequel that can be rejected.	0
It's loud and boring; it's like being trapped in a bad rock concert.	0
merely (and literally) throws sex toys around, offering half-hearted pathos for empowerment that is repeatedly undermined by the brutality of jokes, mostly at the expense of women.	0
If you want to take a trip back in time, the 1960 version is a much more pleasant one.	0
It's about the kind of pre-chewed racial stereotypes that have already gone through the corporate stand-up comedy mill.	0
The story is - if you will pardon the expression - a little thin and the filmmaking clumsy and rushed.	0
is noticeably thinner with its many oversized, out-of-character and logically permeable action parts.	0
I wish the windtalkers had more faith in the dramatic potential of this true story That would have been better than the fiction she concocted, and there could have been room for the war scenes.	0
Aggressive self-aggrandisement and manipulative whitewashing. Stay in the credits and see a scathing comic impersonation by Dustin Hoffman that is revealed.	0
None of the characters or storylines are concrete enough to spark interest.	0
As a social exposé, skin has its heart in the right place, but that's not much to hang a soap opera on.	0
The whole film has this sneaky feeling, as if the director is trying to deceive the viewer into thinking everything is very important just because the film is ugly to look at and not a Hollywood product.	0
There's a bit of thematic flesh on the bones of the Queen of the Damned, as its origins dictate in a rice novel by Anne Rice, but generally it's a film that puts style above character and content.	0
The only way to tolerate this bland, brutally clueless film might be a large dose of pain medication.	0
This one is certainly well-intentioned, but also simple and invented.	0
Coppola has made a film of heady atmosphere and little else.	0
Bad and confusing from the start.	0
A series of immaculately composed shots of quietly freaking out Patch Adams does not make a great film.	0
At a time when we have learned the hard way how complex international terrorism is, collateral damage paints an absurdly simple picture.	0
the impulses that led to this project.   are laudable, but the results are mixed.	0
A well-acted film that just doesn't work.	0
like a can of 2-day-old cola. You can try it, but there's no excitement.	0
There's no excuse for watching a glorious, well-made family movie with a computer-generated fish.	0
Both the crime thriller and the love story are unusual. But they don't go well together and neither is well told.	0
It is both sitcom-like and poignant.	0
Apart from a slightly rousing central romance, hospital is at best sick entertainment and at worst mind-destroying cinematic pollution.	0
jaglom offers the not too original premise that anyone involved in filmmaking is a con artist and liar.	0
Apart from Burger's desire to make some kind of film, it's really unclear why this project was done	0
was I afraid? Not until the prospect of Beck's next project. Let's see, a haunted house, a haunted ship, what comes next.   Ghost plane?	0
A fragile frame on which to hang wide, lightly crafted characters summoned just 10 minutes before shooting.	0
As the action spreads in an increasingly incoherent manner, one may wish for a clock that passes faster than vice versa.	0
Because Lee is a sentimentalist, the film is more deferential than your random E! True Hollywood story.	0
"Wes Craven's presence is felt; not the craven of ""a nightmare on Elm Street"" or ""the hills have eyes,"" but the sad schlock merchant of ""deadly friend."""	0
The Sunshine State examines the landscape and assesses the issues with a clear passion for sociology. But the cinematography is murky, the picture murky.	0
It's a long bore.	0
It gets old fast. If you need a cube, check out the hair salon - it's not worth it.	0
It's leaden and predictable, and lacks laughter.	0
A cinematic disaster so unintentionally worth the price of admission simply because of the mocking factor.	0
Skip this filth, rent a shelter and go back to source.	0
The film is a desperate misjudgment. t give poor dana carvey anything to do that is really funny, and then expect us to laugh because he is acting so stupid all the time.	0
We just don't care too much about this love story. In this environment, their struggle is simply too ridiculous and borderline.	0
the van bombards the spectator with so many explosions and swipes that he gets surprisingly boring at the end.	0
Uzumaki's interesting social parallel and defiant aesthetic seem like a prostitute muse.	0
Men in Black II creates a new threat to the mib, but recycles the same premise	0
Despite its big budget, the film is such a fleeting glimpse of the radar screen of the year that it's tempting to take it along on the ride. But this time the old mib label stands for milder is no better.	0
feels familiar and tired.	0
a retreading of the material, which has already been thoroughly explored by Martin Scorsese	0
Instead of making his own style, director marcus only gives copies from different sources, a bad mix	0
Criminal conspiracies and true romances move so easily across ethnic and cultural boundaries in the film that my grand Greek wedding looks like an apartheid drama.	0
a hole that tends to hit every point home.	0
A story that fails to rise above its sickening source material.	0
It is fitting that a film as artificial and soulless as the country owes its creation to an animated screening at Disneyland.	0
"""The Big Bang Theory"" begins as an intense political and psychological thriller, but is sabotaged by ticking time bombs and other Hollywood action cliches"	0
completely creative stillborn and executed in a way that I am not sure could be one iota worse.   a soulless pile of exploitative rubbish	0
an uneven view of a bleak future that does not come close to the intelligence and visual brilliance seen in other Philippine films. Great stories.	0
Horrible	0
The incoherent mess flows as naturally as Jolie's hideous yellow.	0
Strengthened by an amazing cast (with the exception of Love Hewitt), interesting ethnic tensions and a story I haven't seen since Pep's dragons.	0
an authentically vague but ultimately futile study in total pandemonium.	0
makes a joke out of chases and then gives us half an hour chases.	0
As the sulky, moody male bungler in the title role, [franco] has all the mannerisms and complacency of the Dean, but none of his sweetness and vulnerability.	0
"The only thing to fear about ""Angstdot com"" is to bang your head on the cinema chair in front of you when you fall asleep for thirty minutes in the film."	0
it is too interested in slipping into all its Byzantine incarnations to entertain its audience.	0
"""Synthetic"" is the best description for this well-meaning, beautifully produced film, which sacrifices its promise of a high-profile celebrity pedigree."	0
It focuses far too much on the awkward interaction and total lack of chemistry between Chan and Hewitt.	0
Fraudsters can't think of anything to do with these characters, except to run them through dark tunnels, fend off various anonymous attackers, and evade sophisticated surveillance technologies.	0
Richter's characters should take the long-lived bestselling intelligent women, foolish advice.	0
The script has less spice than a rat burger and the martial arts of the rock are more like Steven Seagal.	0
This ill-conceived and expensive project ends up looking like a bunch of talented theses that lie dormant.	0
The whole company has a choppy surface.	0
The New York Times fails to get the job done, running away from the limited chemistry of Russell Fiennes and Jennifer Lopez.	0
A particularly joyless and utterly boring coming-of-age story.	0
It is impossible to indulge in the imaginative daydreams of a janice bart (eileen walsh) when her real personality is so charming and empty.	0
"It wasn't the subject that ultimately defeated the film, it was the unfulfilling, incongruous ""Wait a minute, did I miss something?"" End."	0
This is a film where the most remarkable observation is how long you sit still.	0
Poor editing, bad bluescreen and ultra-kitsch dialogue underscore the radical action.	0
It's super violent, super serious and super stupid.	0
so serious and well-meaning and so full of talent that one almost forgets the sheer, ponderous horror of the script.	0
Just a bunch of stale gags, with no good inner life and no bite.	0
You can't do it without the jokes.	0
The lock would have benefited from a sharper, cleaner script before going on camera. Not to mention a sharper, cleaner camera lens.	0
Flat, loud and pretentious.	0
Morrissette has indeed done a difficult job - he has recorded one of the most fascinating stories in the world and made it boring, lifeless and irritating.	0
The grandfather of the Nouvelle Vague, Jean-Luc Godard, continues to amaze the faithful with his games of hide and seek.	0
This loud and utterly sickening comedy about a bickering working-class couple is a deeply unpleasant experience.	0
It's better than the phantom threat. But if you're not an absolute Star Wars junkie, it's no fun.	0
Philosophically, intellectually and logistically a mess.	0
A classic police drama that would probably have ended an original without de Niro's involvement.	0
Coupled with shamefully written dialogue and fluttering body movements replacing acting, it's a clumsy soap opera-like story.	0
The Hollywood ending is just not particularly funny.	0
Though clearly well-intentioned, this intercultural soap opera is painfully formulaic and dull.	0
a technical triumph and an extraordinary bore	0
I can well imagine that the Pinocchio of benigni will become a Christmas tree. Coal is not as easy to get as it used to be, and that would be a worthy substitute for naughty child stockings	0
Two hours of rubbish.	0
In the end, it's all about gorgeous costumes, gorgeous, large-format scenery and Joan's crazy decision to stand by her husband no matter how often he turns out to be a disloyal satyr.	0
Compulsive, misguided and ill-informed though they may be.	0
A clumsily produced exploitative film, an unstinting exercise in manipulation and chaos.	0
The whole story, true or not, feels incredibly crazy.   [it] comes like a trademark ad.	0
"What is missing is the so-called ""wow factor."""	0
The nicest thing you can say about stealing crops (which you could call Freddy being harassed by a dog) is that it's not as disgusting as Tom Green's freddy fingers.	0
Tara Reid plays a college journalist, but she looks like the six-time Miss Hawaii pageant winner, so I don't know what she's doing.	0
The young stars are too sweet; the story and the complications are too manipulative; the message is too blunt; the resolutions are too practical.	0
Normally, I'm fascinated by Rohmer's sound films, but when he shifts his locations into the past and relies on a historical text, he loses the richness of characterisation that makes his films so memorable.	0
I highly recommend Irwin, but not in the way this film portrays him.	0
It's been 13 months and 295 screenings since I last saw a film, but the evil in the country deserves my outraged, pre-emptive goodbye.	0
That image is largely a lump of ordinary profanity, peppered with a few remarks so designed to elicit sympathy from the public that one might think he is running for office - or trying to win a parole officer.	0
Malone has a gift for creating nightmarish images that are hard to burn out of the brain. But the narrative hook of the film is far too muddled to be an effectively chilling pleasure.	0
Although it goes beyond both, anyone who has seen Hunger or Cat Man will find little new here, but a palatable performance of compelling Gallo elevates this story of cannibalistic lust above the ordinary.	0
An adventure in the style of a witch, set like a bad soap opera, with passable performances by all actors.	0
Diaz wears down her welcome in her most charming appearance	0
It's a pity this sympathetic film isn't more complete. The actors do their best, but come across as amateurish and awkward.	0

the screenplay by james eric, james horton and director peter o'fallon   is so patting that the teeth hurt.	0

Director Rob Kumble seems to have given up a lot of plot in favour of the film, trimming the film to a brisk 84 minutes.   Outrageous gags.	0

The comedy Death Too Smooth is a sickening oddity: a film without an audience.	0
Barney's ideas about creation and identity don't seem to be very profound, at least in terms of the lessons learned from this three-hour endurance test, worth about an hour of material.	0
Affleck is merely creating a blueprint for a role he has yet to grow into - a role he effortlessly fills with authority	0
Aside from the cinematic pyrotechnics, Avary seems to care only about nasty giggles and dressing. it makes sense that he went back to school to watch the girls - his film is the idea of a cool boy having a good time.	0

It is harmless, cheerful, built to inspire young people, set to an endless soundtrack of beach party pop numbers, and apart from its remarkable cinematography and fantastic scenery, it is about as exciting as sunburn.	0
His comedic premises are often hackneyed or just clumsy, designed to elicit shocked laughter without going to a deeper level.	0
Christina Ricci's comedy about sympathy, hypocrisy and love is a false start	0
Sometimes the tension is palpable, but at the end you get the feeling that the essence of the mystery lies in a formality that burdens credulity and haunts the viewer with the waste of potential.	0
They should have called it a trickle.	0

The film is based on truth, yet feels a bit incomplete, as if the true story starts just around the corner.	0

Zaidan's script barely has enough plot to string the stunts together, and not enough characterisation to keep the faces straight.	0
"I can't think of a single good reason to see this film, even though everyone in my group spontaneously shouted, ""Thanks!"" when Leguizamo finally put in an irritating character late in the film."	0
It's nice to watch a film that isn't too boring, but Yu's cinematic alchemy produces almost as much lead as gold.	0
She treats women like idiots.	0
"Though ""Catch me if you can"" isn't bad, the fun slowly seeps out of the movie."	0
Just an average comedic record, but no waste of time	0
A worthless children's song about professional basketball signed by the nba.	0
Stooge has a handful of thrilling moments and some good performances, but the film doesn't quite fly. For starters, the story is just too thin.	0
So much simple technology, so many sweet ideas, so little film.	0
The experience of going to a film festival is a rewarding experience; the experience of trying one through this film is not.	0
The film takes footage of human tragedies and dresses them in beautiful costumes, Southern California settings and star power.	0
It has its moments of swaggering camaraderie, but often feels generic, derivative and dead.	0
Almost gags on its own.	0
How do you spell a cliché?	0
It's sweet, harmless, silly, occasionally funny and about as compelling as a fishing show.	0
The cinematic equivalent of going to a dinner party and being forced to watch the host and hostess's home video of their baby's birth.	0
[Hill] has learned new tricks, but the tricks alone are not enough to save this lifeless boxing film.	0
"In the real world, an actor of this uncharismatic beauty would have a resume full of credits like ""Girl in Bar 3."""	0
Too much of it feels unfocused and underdeveloped.	0
Under 15? One minute giggling. Over 15 years? Time wasting.	0
Hey arnold! The film is what happens when you blow small potatoes to ten times their natural size, and it's not pretty.	0
Sometimes it seems less like storytelling than something the otherwise compelling director needed to get off his chest.	0
This is not the undisputed worst boxing film of all time, but it is certainly not a champion - the big loser is the audience.	0
One really has to wonder how on earth anyone, anywhere else, could have believed that he was making the audience watch with such an absolutely diabolical script.	0
In the end, we are left with something like two ships passing by at night, and no insights into gay love, Chinese society, or the price of being dishonest.	0
suffocates at its own representation of the topmost crust.	0
Almost unbearable.   Although the picture strives to become cinematic poetry, it remains depressingly sober and boring.	0
I thought my own clock had stopped keeping time as I wound through the clocks.	0
While much of the cast is charming - especially Allodi and Nold - the actors are overwhelmed by the film's primitive approach to comedy.	0
This directorial debut from the music video showdown with Highuchinsky is all flash.	0
Yes, ballistic is stupid. Unfortunately, it's no silly fun, unless you enjoy really bad movies.	0
The twist that ends the film is the one with the most emotional resonance, but the twists become irritating, and this is the kind of material that filmmakers should be very careful to raise eyebrows.	0
The longer the film goes on, the worse it gets, but in the first few minutes it's actually pretty good.	0
While it's really cool to hear characters talk about early rap records (Sugar Hill Gang, etc.) , the constant reference to hip-hop arcana can alienate even the most savvy audience.	0
Not only unfunny, but downright disgusting.	0
Carefully captures the wonder and menace of growing up, but he never really finds the joy in Fuhrman's destructive escapism or the grace in rebellion his characters find.	0
forced, familiar and thoroughly condescending.	0
does little more than play a harmless game, filling gaps with a tragic past.	0
k-19 exploits our considerable collective fear of the nuclear holocaust to create cheap tensions.	0
has a long and bulky end.   , which forces the audience to wriggle through ten pseudo-serious minutes while waiting for the credits and edited montage of the scenes to break the awkward silence of the audience	0
A hotchpotch of promising ideas and failed narratives, good acting and old bad filmmaking.	0
Woody's determination to plunge you into sheer, relentless misery is exhausting.	0
unusually stylish, but just as silly.   The picture does not generate much tension, nor does it ask enough questions to justify its claims.	0
The whole film is about a boring, sad man who is boring and sad.	0
The plot twists add up to nothing more than breaking the audience chain.	0
confirms the nagging suspicion that Hawk behind the camera would be even worse than before.	0
without recognizable craft and monstrously hypocritical in dealing with the loss of childhood	0
It's a trifle of a film, with a few laughs around an unremarkable soft centre.	0
Holden Caulfield did better.	0
A synthesis of clichés and absurdities that, in its cinematic flash and emptiness, seems almost decadent.	0
Oh, come on. As if you couldn't smell that turkey rotting for miles	0
if it is seldom boring, then it is seldom consistent.	0
Simplistic fluffy balls of whimsy.	0
Not exactly the bees	0
There is nothing new about the old story except to show fist fights in this kind of stop-go slow motion that makes the gang fights look like they are being broadcast via a 28k modem.	0
The kind of spectacularly misguided undertaking that only a sophisticated moviegoer could have committed.	0
provides a truly strange, sometimes confusing children's entertainment.   But at least this time there are a few centered stories that fit all that weird stuff.	0
There are no good jokes, no good scenes, hardly a moment in which Carvey's live Saturday miming rises above the level of embarrassment.	0
Jacqueline's rendition of Puccini's tale of devotion and the double cross is more than a film opera. In his first stab at form, Jacquot takes a slightly anarchic approach that only works sporadically.	0
Chabrol has taken promising material for a black comedy and turned it into a dark chamber play.	0
It is like watching a film that was made in 1978 but was not released at the time because it was so weak, and that has now been dug up and released where it is even weaker.	0
This is nothing more than familiar territory.	0
In execution, this clever idea is far less funny than the original, Killer from Space.	0
one of the most irritating cartoons you will see this year or any other.	0
A broad, melodramatic opera of oestrogen, which is itself rather toxic.	0
Too slow, too long and too little happening.	0
The few ideas of the film are stretched to evaporation; the entire middle section is one big chase that seems to have no purpose or urgency. It's just filler.	0
With his unobjective attitude, he sacrifices the value of his archival wealth.	0
Roberto Benigni's Pinocchio is an astonishingly bad film that lacks charm, wit and inventiveness.	0
A romantic comedy that makes our girl the unfortunate mediator of an extended cheap shot across the Mason-Dixon border.	0
does not score with originality, wit or intelligence. It's a cookie-cutter movie, a cut-and-paste job.	0
It takes them a long time to come to their gasping end.	0
hardly gets going.	0
Even on the rare occasions when the narrator stops whining, Müller's hand is often uncertain.	0
"Pumpkin is an outrageously dark satire about the life of the fraternity, but its ambitions far exceed the abilities of writer Adam Larson Broder and his co-director Tony R. In her feature film debut ""The Man Who Saved Me."""	0
At its best, Queen is campy fun like the award-winning horror classics of the 1960s. At worst, it implodes into a series of very bad special effects.	0
Even in the opening scenes it becomes clear that the Benjamines are a completely formulaic film.	0
"It takes a certain kind of horror film to be classified as ""worse than expected,"" but Ghost Ship somehow manages that."	0
on the bright side it contains jesse ventura's best work since the xml.	0
Despite impeccable behaviour.   and a script that takes some rather unexpected (sometimes even absurd) twists, love is just too precious in the end.	0
A TV thriller with some big-screen moments (including one that seems to be made for a very different film).	0
Involving myself in the visuals and eccentricities of many characters, I found myself confused when it was time to get to the heart of the film.	0
Too often, the viewer does not react so much to humour, but shrugs it off.	0
What happens next? Revenge of the Pigs: ultimate release?	0
Dilbert without the right satirical humour.	0
manages to show life in all its banality when the intention is the opposite.	0
you do not see this movie.	0
Minority report is exactly what the title says, a report.	0
delivers the same old one, tarted with Latin flava and shot by hollywood playas	0
If you believe any of this, I can give you a real deal with leftover enron shares, which will lose a week's worth from Friday.	0
"To call the other side of the sky ""appalling"" is to underestimate how dangerous such conversations can be."	0
In exactly 89 minutes, most of which passed as slowly as sitting naked on an igloo, Formula 51 went from quirky to jerky to total turkey.	0
if only the story about a multi-million dollar fraudster bothered to include the fraudster	0
I have to say the star and the director are the big problems here.	0
Without the dark creepiness of the Crystal Lake camp, the horror concept loses its creepy menace completely.	0
it is like every bad idea that has ever gone into an extracurricular special put together in one place, without the slipperiness and sophistication of these daily programs (and who knew they even had any?)	0
While the evil games based there have set new standards for thrills, suspense and gore for video games, the film actually only manages the third.	0
For almost two hours, the audience has to endure three terminally depressed, mostly inarticulate, hyperdysfunctional families at the price of one.	0
I think the cartoon characters in the film come dangerously close to a new generation.	0
What the director can't do is make Val Kilmer's characters interesting or desirable.	0
I suspect that in an effort not to offend by appearing either too serious or too light-hearted, you offend simply by wishful thinking.	0
It is hard to imagine the process that led to such a script, but here it is suggested that spray cheese and underarm noises played a crucial role.	0
Harland Williams is so witty in drag he should consider having a permanent sex change.	0
Nothing scary here except some terrible actors and lame special effects.	0
It's not that kung fu movies aren't funny sometimes - it's just no funnier than bad martial arts movies being all by themselves, without all the filthy booze.	0
A very long film, boring, with too much focus on food preparation and igloo construction.	0
Not an obnoxious or boring film; it just lacks everything except good intentions.	0
A science fiction pastiche so lacking in originality that if you took your inspiration away, there would be little left.	0
Once [kim] starts exaggerating the shock tactics and lure metaphors, you may decide that the price of a dazzling postcard is too high.	0
"The words ""Honestly, darling, I'm not damning myself"" have never been more appropriate."	0
"What's next: ""My mom's car?"""	0
All the spiced-up stunts in the style of the hawks and the thrashing rap metal can't hide the fact that we really did.	0
A sequel that's way too big for its Brits	0
is so relentlessly horrible that being called a dog is probably an atrocity against dogs.	0
What was once original has been hijacked so often that it now seems pedestrian.	0
is a startling example of unfulfilled promises, despite many charming moments.	0
Despite all the twists and turns, tears, anger and opium overdoses, there is no sense that true passion is washed away in the dissolution of love.	0
a crude and stupid gross-out.	0
A nightmare date with half-hearted wit that has done a disservice to the liberal arts academy's lack of critical distance and sad trust in platitudes.	0
offers little but frivolous soullessness, crude language and a series of brutal set pieces.   , which raise the bar for stylized screen violence.	0
There is potential here, but like Lavinia, the film opts for the conservative path.	0
It's a pussy-ass world when even killer thrillers revolve around group therapy sessions	0
The pared-down approach lends the film a certain timelessness, but the measured pace and lack of dramatic agility can be tiring.	0
But the power of these [subjects] is obscured by the bulk of the film, which shows a stationary camera on a subject that could be mistaken for a public speech, rather than contributing to the narrative of a film.	0
Rarely has so much money brought so little entertainment.	0
tries to add some spice to his quirky feelings, but the taste is too familiar.	0
In fact, the full payment is so old-fashioned that the film's most vivid scene is clips from Brian de Palma's scarf. This is a scam.	0
Harrison's flowers put their hearts in the right place, but their brains are not in any particular place.	0
This repetition is so stupid and exploitative in its violence that it ironically becomes everything the somewhat clumsy original railed against.	0
a series of warmed-up gags based on weak vulgarity.	0
The film is the dawn of the dead crossed by the ghosts of Mars, with zombies that are not as spooky as the first and trains that are not as big as the second.	0
Basically a static series of half-improvised (and half-connected) raps between the stars.	0
Too reserved to be a freak show, too mercenary and obvious to be cerebral, too boring and pretentious to engage.   The island eludes a simple classification.	0
an unpredictable mix of buddy smart talk, romantic comedy and dark tragedy that bites far more than writer / director john mckay can swallow	0
It is one of those baseball pictures where the hero is stoic, the wife patient, the children as sweet as any and the chances of success long enough to be intimidating but short enough to make a dream possible.	0
"""The Time Machine"" is a film that has no interest in itself. it doesn't believe in itself, it doesn't have a sense of humour, it's just boring."	0
A hollow joke, told by a film gymnast who has too much fun glossing over the misanthropic story to actually tell.	0
"A dark little soap opera about three sleepy, insensitive people hurting each other. It's a full-length adaptation of one of those ""Can this marriage be saved?"" Columns from the Ladies Home Journal."	0
The movie is essentially over.	0
I'm sure if you're a die-hard fan, you'll have fun.   I didn't care.	0
It's about following your dreams, no matter what your parents think. Socrates makes applications for hemlock.	0
The script is not very good; not even someone as talented as Hoffman (the actor) can make it work.	0
Walter Hill's mushy, stylised boxing melodrama almost overcomes his questionable fight in the ring with solid fight choreography and raw prison authenticity.	0
It has all the excitement of eating oatmeal.	0
It is hard to say whether to recommend this film or not, because for everything it does right, there is at least one and sometimes two things it does wrong.	0
Although there are several truly harrowing horrors, there are also plenty of hackneyed dialogue and silkier diabolical business than shaking a severed limb.	0
Bet the video game is much more fun than the movie.	0
Star Trek: Nemesis is gently going where almost every Star Trek movie has gone before. Twitching dialogue, thrifty store costumes, prosthetic make-up with silly putty and Kmart blue-light special effects conspired to test Trekkie loyalty.	0
Like all abstract art, the film does not make this statement in an easily accessible way, and it would be perfectly possible for a reasonably intelligent person to sit through its flood of images and not get this vision at all.	0
I don't mind my heart strings being pulled, but don't treat me like a fool	0
"Although this idea is ""new,"" the results are tired."	0
I suspect the director is a wizard. After all, he took three minutes of dialogue, 30 seconds of action and turned it into a 90-minute film that lasted five hours.	0
an unencouraging triple expansion of the former mtv series, which accompanies the stunt-hungry bigheads in a random series of collected gags, pranks, pratfalls, ventures, injuries etc.	0
The script is a mindless pairing of teenage talk and animal gibberish.	0
Its source of thorn and vinegar (and common humanity) has long been plundered by similar works that exhibit the insight and penetration that this image so clearly lacks.	0
Despite her impressive craftsmanship and an overbearing set of crescendos in Act III, Lily chou-chou never really builds emotional steam.	0
Don't be fooled by the impressive cast list - you are, as you can see, rubbish.	0
Since Freddy was fingered, it has not been so painful to sit through a major release.	0
The documentary does little but raise the subject to further stimulate conversation.	0
plays like a fleeting and overlong magazine fashion spread.	0
A better title could sweep under the carpet for all concerned.	0
This film seems to be written with insanity. It cannot be otherwise. Funnily inept and ridiculous.	0
Vera's technical prowess ultimately sells his film as a short film; he even smoothes out hard truths when discovering them.	0
[A] shapeless lump of desperate conversation.	0
feels too formulaic and too familiar to produce the cross-border thrill of early underground.	0
Generic thriller rubbish. Only teenagers.	0
Given the clumsiness and clumsiness, this could be the worst Soderbergh has ever done.	0
a numerically ordered patient / doctor picture, which includes everything usual	0
A stupid movie with stupid characters doing stupid things and you have to be really stupid not to see where that leads.	0
The theft of crops is a comedic larceny, but is condemned for nothing more than petty theft.	0
Presumption is in its own way a form of bravery. For that reason, and only for that reason - the power of her own staunch, hostile beliefs - Chelsea Wall deserves a medal.	0
With the exception of some fleetingly amusing improvisations by Cedric, the entertainer as Perry's boss, there is no redeeming moment.	0
It's a bag of genres that don't make much sense.	0
Film fans, get ready to stand out.   in the other direction.	0
[Director] o'fallon manages to bring some beautiful images to the big screen, but his ability to tell a story - he also worked on the script - falls short.	0
The intention is almost exactly the same [as all the money]. The only thing missing is spontaneity, originality and joy.	0
No one but a convicted person guilty of a truly heinous crime should have to sit through the master of disguise.	0
Even the best chef can't make a hot dog anything more than a hot dog, and Robert de Niro can't make this movie more than a trashy cop comedy.	0
The second half is too mendacious, and what began as a fascinating look at youth fizzles out in a tedious, ridiculous attempt to tug the heart.	0
It's not without its pleasures, but I stick to it.	0
Müller plays so freely with emotions and the fact that children are hostages to happiness that he makes the audience hostage to his swaggering affection.	0
Despite the evocative aesthetic that hints at the hollow state of modern love life, the film never goes beyond a monotonous whine.	0
maudlin rather than sharp.	0
This is a selfish endeavor by the daughter of horror director Dario Argento (here a producer), but her raw performance and utter fearlessness make it strangely attractive.	0
It's slow - very, very slow. It's not the ultimate gangster movie of depression. This is pure PR hype.	0
Characters still need to function on a set of credible and understandable impulses, no matter how many drugs they take or how much artistic license Avary uses.	0
Uncomfortably close to the traces of bicycle theft	0
Visually stunning, but ultimately a pretty-looking boredom, the real creativity would be to completely hide and reinvent the treasure planet.	0
The theft of crops is proof that the farrelle Bros -- Peter and Bob -- and their kind of on-screen comedy come to an end, along with Green's half-hearted film career.	0
There seems to be no clear path to where the story is going or how long it will take to arrive.	0
If you are a WWF fan, or you are related to the people who watched the robots being slaughtered in an abattoir.  you will probably like rollerball.	0
I don't think I ever laughed out loud. And when you talk about a slapstick comedy, that's a pretty big problem.	0
It's so mediocre, despite the dynamic duo in the marquee, that we just can't be satisfied.	0
Slapstick stupidity can tickle the imagination of some preschoolers, but if it costs a family of four about $40 to see a movie in the cinema, why spend money on such a dog when you can hire a family tree instead?	0
becomes so unforgivably banal in the last 10 minutes that anyone who doesn't have a sweet tooth is likely to fall into a sugar shock.	0
The idea that bombing buildings is the funniest thing in the world goes completely unnoticed in this stunningly unfunny comedy.	0
my reaction in one word: disappointment. His last film was poetically romantic and full of indelible images, but his last one has it.	0
It works somehow and is sometimes considered cool, but is just too lame to work or be cool.	0
maintains its dreamlike glide through a succession of cheesy coincidences and sensual cheap effects, not least through Rebecca romijn-stamos	0
This is a fascinating documentary that is emotionally diluted by focusing on the least interesting subject in history.	0
A mystery.	0
feels arbitrary, as if the writers mistakenly thought they could create a whiff of frantic spontaneity by just throwing in a lot of characters doing stupid stuff and stirring the pot.	0
What an embarrassment.	0
Each giggle comes with at least 10 complete misses, many of them from the astonishingly lifelike Tara Reid, whose acting skills are comparable to a cardboard cutout.	0
In his own way, Joshua is as blasphemous and nonsensical as a Luis Buñuel film without his intelligence, poetry, passion and genius.	0
I've always dreamed of participating in canned food, but after seeing this movie, it's no big deal.	0
The vintage is pure '87, with a half-hearted twist on his cautionary message: fatal attraction = not having an affair with a weirdo; unfaithful = not when married.	0
There is a workshop mentality.	0
It cannot be enjoyed, not even at the level of enjoying a bad slasher movie, especially because it is boring. Yes, boring.	0
Pumpkin wants both.	0
Director uwe boll and the actors offer little reason to care in this crude 1970s throwback.	0
[w] long wait for amiable monkeys and worthy environmental protection, Jane Goodall's wild chimpanzees lack the thrill demanded by the oversized medium.	0
Space fans may love this movie, but others will only experience its delights occasionally.	0
"This Channel 5 ""s Grade 5 trash is, frankly, an insult to the intelligence of the true genre enthusiast."	0
an occasionally comical but altogether saggy story about fish out of water.	0
is a bloated thespian grotesquely impressed by her own gigantic aura of self-respect.	0
It is mightily exhausting for the viewer, who has to contend with unpleasant characters, messy performances and clumsily staged scenes.	0
turns out to be a sudsy tub of supernatural hocus pocus, not even ms Redgrave's noblest efforts can free him from hopeless sentimentality.	0
The Playboy mansion presentation of her new best friend's college life is ridiculous.	0
"A horrible ""ace ventura"" rip-off that somehow manages to bring Kevin Pollak, former wrestler Chyna and Dolly Parton together If one of them lists this ""credit"" on his CV in the future, it will be much funnier than anything in the film."	0
The humour is forced and ponderous and sometimes simply unpleasant.	0
Scorsese at his best makes gangster movies that are equally beautiful, but also mercilessly brutal and brutally intelligent; Destruction, on the other hand, reads more like missing daisies than Goodfella.	0
Although the script starts promisingly, it loses steam towards the middle and never really develops beyond obvious attacks.	0
"The latest bid in the ""TV-to-Movie"" franchise, i spy is hitting the cinema screen with little of the annoying originality of its groundbreaking predecessor."	0
That's not even Madonna's way. This is their blue lagoon.	0
The director knows how to apply textured luster, but his portrait of sex as war is strictly sitcom.	0
The film suffers from a lack of humor (something that is needed to balance the violence).	0
Burns never really makes full use of the energetic cast.	0
is an overstated, crazy and ultimately tiring sex farce.	0
has all the depth of a paddling pool.	0
This is the kind of massive action flick in which one accident upsets the other, the narrative necessity is a drunken carousel, and anything that passes as logical is a factor in the last remaining plot tool.	0
the so-called inept- it's-surreal dubbing (with the voices of glenn close, regis philbin and breckin meyer) evokes memories of kitschy old blunders.	0
The film is just an old monster.	0
If this disposable sling has a wildcard, it's John Turro, who just happens to be a Spanish butler with foot fetish.	0
a long chain of clichés.	0
A noble failure.	0
A real downer? [leigh] lays it on so thick this time it feels like a suicide run.	0
Professionally, it's tempting to jump on a ship in January to avoid ridiculous mess like this sloppy tension thriller.	0
Nelson's brutally unsentimental approach.   sucks humanity out of the film, leaving behind a terrible but strangely emotionless spectacle.	0
with its disturbingly close look at the damaged psyche and its subtle undercurrents of danger. But its clumsy structure breaks the spell.	0
unbaked and overheated.	0
There's a solid women's and self-discovery story somewhere here, but you'd have to dig pretty deep to find it.	0
I still can't identify with Stuart: he's a mouse, for example, he screams loudly, and all he does is milk it with despondent eyes and moan that no one is treating him human enough.	0
[Serry] wants to combine politics and drama, an admirable goal. It's a pity that the helping hand he uses to stir his ingredients is also heavy.	0
by the lousy standards to which the slasher genre has fallen.   Pretty good actually. With more objective measurements, of course, it is still pretty bad.	0
The only entertainment you will draw from this choppy and sloppy affair is the unintentional giggle.	0
"At school, the theme of ""soft landings and easy ways out"" prevailed."	0
lástima por schwarzenegger, pero es hora de que deje la estafeta a las nuevas generaciones.	0
is exactly what it claims to be - a simple distraction for children.	0
His story may be a thousand years old, but why did it need another thousand years to tell us?	0
Pathetic arrogance.	0
The problem with this film is that it lacks focus. I sympathise with the plight of these families, but the film does not do a very good job of conveying the theme.	0
A momentary escape from the summer heat and the sedentary doldrums that have set in this time of year.	0
Think of it as an American cake on Valium.	0
Dull, lifeless and amateurish.	0
"It is a confusion of language ""based on true events,"" which suggests that it is impossible to claim that it is ""based on a true story."""	0
"An act as lumpy as two-day-old porridge.   Sadly, the filmmakers ""paws were everywhere about this"" not very strong ""project!"	0
Irritating scrupulous rubbish.	0
It's bad when a movie has about as much substance as its credits.	0
"With its dogged Hollywood naturalism and its characters ""inexorable transition to sainthood, Windtalkers is nothing more than sticky-sweet soap."	0
Some of it is clever, but never melodic /	0
A relative decline.	0
Better just call it abc kiarostami. for aid and Africa are no more than part of the landscape.	0
No social import aspirations determine the film version. This is a shameless sham designed to exploit the popularity of its stars	0
manages to be reasonably well played, not badly staged and completely non-committal, no matter how hard it tries to be exciting, touching or, oops, exciting.	0
Warmed-up hash.	0
This rather superficial middle-brow arthouse film knows how to satisfy an audience, and that's about all it does well.	0
It is clear that the filmmakers were not sure where they wanted their story to go, and even more clear that they lacked the skills to get us to this indefinite destination.	0
as vulgar as it is banal.	0
It's a puzzling experience.	0
You wonder why it wasn't just a music video, but a full movie.	0
The sound and tempo of the film are almost off the mark.	0
the talented and clever robert rodriguez has perhaps given his first film a little too much and not reserved enough for his second.	0
Wine downer as corrupting comments.	0
Tambor and Clay make him an attractive couple, he's unobtrusive and sardonic, she's attractively manic and energetic. Both deserve better.	0
Stifled by its fussy script and cramped characters, this grumpy adaptation is all the more annoying because it was packed by Hollywood and sold back to us.	0
coughs and stutters at his own postmodern imagination.	0
a completely contradictory emotional experience.	0
Sit through this and you won't need a magic clock to stop time; your DVD player will do it for you.	0
A sometimes tiring film.	0
Teen movies have really gone crazy.	0
There are holes large enough to swim through the killer whale Shamu.	0
, as if someone spun random moments of a Chrysler rock routine into an otherwise clichéd but self-styled agent thriller.	0
Evil, ugly, pointless and depressing, even if you hate clowns.	0
What is 100% missing here is a script that has even the most elementary skills, a sense of real wit and something like acting.	0
Some memorable images.   , but makhmalbaf keeps his distance from the figures	0
It uses the pain and violence of war as background material for color.	0
Just not campy enough	0
Directed by Mike Jackson, the film leaves no cliché untouched, from the predictable plot to the characters coming straight from the central cast.	0
It's everything you don't go to the movies for.	0
Like a dress rehearsal the week before the show: Everything is in place, but something goes wrong.	0
The affectionate mendacity that Demme once seemed innate has a hard time distinguishing between the badly dated cuteness scenario and the newfangled Hollywood post-production effects.	0
For all its technical virtuosity, the film is so entangled in youthful and almost xenophobic pedagogy that it is enough to set a jaw for the day when God can no longer handle the rigors of filmmaking.	0
The American chai encourages shabby laughter at stereotypes that only Indians would recognize. And the lesson is nothing new.	0
It made me tear my eyes out of my head and throw them at the screen.	0
Due to some weaknesses in the script and the casting of the director's brother, the film becomes irrelevant.	0
Holes so large and obvious that a marching band might as well stomp through them dressed as clowns and play a college football song on untuned instruments.	0
so devoid of any comprehensible story that movies like xxx and collateral damage seem like thoughtful essays	0
With its combination of fast editing and blaring heavy metal, beck seems to have the illusion of recording the latest downvideo system.	0
Dragonfly has no atmosphere, no suspense - nothing but expensive, run away. It's a no-brainer.	0
works hard to establish round characters, but then has nothing new or particularly interesting to say about them.	0
The plot switches between past and present, but the material connection is too weak to anchor the emotional ties that supposedly span a 125-year gap.	0
"The nonsensical, boring ""cyber-horror"" film is a dark, hollow exercise in shallow scaremongering and bad acting."	0
Instead of hiding Pinocchio from critics, Miramax should have hidden it from everyone.	0
manages to be both repulsively sadistic and worldly.	0
A great ensemble cannot lift this concern from the heart.	0
There should be a judge's licence to strip him of burns.	0
The structure the film takes could see Matt Damon and Ben Affleck reunite in search of leftovers as this officially concludes a hunting trilogy never planned.	0
While last year's exemplary sexy beast seemed to revive British gangster film, this equally brutal outing merely perpetuates it.	0
a boring parade of talking heads and technical gibberish that will do little to advance the cause of Linux.	0
Perhaps Green wants to hang on to that ski mask, as robbery might be the only way to finance his next project.	0
I can understand childish humour.   But that's the kind of infantility that makes you think about changing the nappies of the director and writer.	0
There's not nearly enough fun here, despite some attractive ingredients.	0
The story of tok (andy lau), an elegant sociopath in the footsteps of o (takashi sorimachi), the most legendary Asian hitman, is too scattered to grasp.	0
Directed in one color by numbers.	0
a cheerful but unforgettable rip-off of [Besson's] earlier work.	0
a lacklustre, insignificant sequel to the classic Disney adaptation by J I am. Barrie's peter pan.	0
Samira Makhmalbaf's new film Tablets resembles the ethos of a stream of consciousness, though it is unfortunate for viewers that the thoughts and reflections that permeate it are lazy and banal	0
Routine, harmless distraction and little else.	0
The stiffness of a late marriage is unlikely to have the emotional clout that characterises it.  Spectators off their feet.	0
This time, Minister. Burns tries something in Martin Scorsese Street-realistic mode, but his self-referential sentimentality gets him up.	0
"While it's funny in itself when Sir Anthony Hopkins says, ""Get in the car, bitch,"" this Jerry Bruckheimer production has little else to offer"	0
It is hampered by a lifetime of plot and a leading lady who is out of her depth.	0
"Let's hope so. -- that the ""true story"" that supposedly ""inspired"" all the Queen's men was staged much funnier and cleverer than what was cobbled together on screen."	0
Is there a group of women who are more absorbed in themselves than mother and daughters in this film? I don't think so. There was nothing wrong with the performances here, but the moody characters bothered me.	0
There is very little fear or apprehension, and while I like the creepy ideas, they are not implemented with more than superficial skill.	0
If you ever had the idea of doing what the title of this film implies, which is actually having sex with strangers, this idea could oust you forever.	0
In the end, despite the best efforts of director Joe Carnahan, the film collapses on its shaky foundation.	0
Adults would like the film to be less simplistic, blatant, clumsy and superficial. But what do adults do in the theatre?	0
Sticky sweet sentimentality, crude conspiracy theories, and a rosy, myopic view of life in the Wwii-era Mississippi Delta undermine this adaptation.	0
It's another stale kill-by-numbers movie, complete with wafer-thin characters and terrible dialogue peppered with puns.	0
Every time you look, sweet Alaabama takes another wrong decision.	0
If you look at this saccharine, Easter-coloured brew, you can see that it consists of three episodes of a rejected television programme.	0
The overall effect is less like a children's movie and more like a recruitment film for future Hollywood sales.	0
Given the seriousness of the drama, the weight of the water is appropriate.	0
It's a fun treat, not least for fans of Malcolm in the Middle and his pubescent star Frankie Muniz	0
Jason x is positively anti-Darwinian: nine sequels and 400 years later, the teenagers are no wiser and Jason is still killing on autopilot.	0
To say that this has been done better in wilder areas is like saying the sun is rising in the east.	0
At least you don't know much more about Derrida when you enter the theatre.	0
The actors are likeable, but Elysian fields are idiotic and absurdly sentimental	0
"As ""Chick Flicks"" goes, this film is pretty pathetic, resorting to string-pulling rather than legitimate character development and intelligent plot."	0
The only excitement comes when the credits finally roll and you are allowed to leave the theatre.	0
there is no emotional impulse for solaris With an emotional sterility that suits her outer environment, Soderbergh's spectacular swing for the fence adds a spectacular touch.	0
It cannot decide whether it wants to be a mystery / thriller, a romance or a comedy.	0
Denis o'neill's script avoids the cliché of elite sport, a last-second goal to win the championship, but neglects few others.	0
The zigzag figure is not developed enough to support a film around it.	0
, whose promising, if rather precious premise is undermined by amateurism.	0
Serving Sara's doesn't exactly raise laughs.	0
The most hopelessly monotonous film of the year, conspicuous only by its gimmick that it was shot in a single, uninterrupted shot.	0
Chelsea is a triple challenge that the public can't focus on.	0
Outdated, pointless scenario.	0
Deathly boring, entangled in convoluted melodrama, nonsensical jargon and stiff upper lip.	0
A misogynistic piece of filth that wants to impersonate hip young adult entertainment.	0
like the residents of Chelsea.   Burdette's collage-like scenario tends to over-romanticize the struggling artist's spiritual desolation.	0
It's basically an overlong episode of stories from the crypt.	0
The film makes a fatal mistake: it asks us to look after a young man whose only obvious virtue is that he is not quite as unpleasant as some people in his life.	0
Another in-your-face wallows in the depths of people who have never sung this blues.	0
Wobbly close-ups of turkey on wheels, stubble chins, liver spots, red noses and the new teetering filmmakers give rise to slight giggles but lead nowhere.	0
I can't really recommend it - it's too patched up - but I can almost; it's the kind of film that makes you like it.	0
Total lack of originality, cleverness or even visible use	0
Though Perry and Hurley make an inspiring effort to breathe life into the incoherent, haphazard screenplay of Jay Scherick and David Ronn, neither the actors nor director Reginald Hudlin can make it more than entertaining.	0
something like a Japanese chalice through the mirror glass, but it seems to take itself much more seriously.	0
It takes talent to make a lifeless film about the most vile man who ever lived.	0
Overall, the film lacks wit, emotion and credibility to compensate for its incessant roughness and banality.	0
The story and friendship run in such a way that one sees a soap opera rather than a chronicle of the ups and downs of lifelong friendships.	0
offers little real romance and even less laughter.   A sad sitcom of a film, largely without charm.	0
makes for a rather unpleasant viewing experience.	0
The film does not do justice to the sum of its parts.	0
Although Hupert's intensity and concentration trigger a raucous frenzy, the piano teacher is anything but fun.	0
It shows Carvey's talent for voices, but not nearly enough and not without a drop of patience to get to the good.	0
Bad. Very bad. Dull, baffling, mentally deaf.	0
The discussion about Kennedy's murder may be rekindled, but this fictional film seems made for cable rather than screen.	0
If you are looking for an exciting science fiction film, you should not settle for this impostor.	0
Not really bad, but tasteless: we now need kidnapping tension dramas like Doomsday Crimes.	0
The result is a gaudy bag of stale sweets, something from a late Halloween.	0
This is not true.   is so in love with her own creation that she cannot see how unbearable the character is.	0
The Man from the Elysian Field is a cold, hapless work that groans and comes up with an important commentary on how life throws us some seductive turns.	0
The messages of compassion and mercy are explained clearly, directly and specifically through computer-animated Old Testament narration of Jonah and the whale. With energetic musicals meant to be fun and fun, the humor didn't quite attract these adults.	0
Historical dramas fused with love triangle are a familiar conceit. But this film lacks the passion to sell the material.	0
Long dead? not nearly long enough.	0
Nothing more substantial than a clumsy doodle.	0
A solid film.   but more conscientious than it really stirs.	0
It is not enough to justify the almost two hours.	0
the x-potion imparts supernatural powers to the quickly named flowers, bubbles and buttercups, which include extraordinary strength and laser eyes, which unfortunately do not enable them to recognize flimsy scripts.	0
In his vision of a burgeoning industrialized world politics, perceptible as a new art form, but far too clunky, didactic and burdened with scenes that simply don't fit this film.	0
Verbinski uses every hack-artist trick to give us the ghosts.	0
McConaughey's fun to watch, the dragons are okay, not much fire in the script.	0
an unwise amalgam of news and vibes.	0
Skins have a right to yawn, and we have a right to our salt grains.	0
Who needs such love?	0
Hit-and-miss in terms of comedy, and a big Ole'miss in terms of history.	0
Sandler, who also serves as a producer, has made a film that makes earlier vehicles look smart and brash.	0
exists as an occasionally revealing acting exercise.	0
Banal, banal, clichéd, mostly harmless.	0
Mattei is tiresomely earnest and long-winded, as if the circular shape itself indicated profundity.	0
It's not original, and, deprived of the element of surprise, it has no great laughs in its story of irresponsible policemen who like to play pranks.	0
whenever his story is not determined by idiocy with cia and a lost u.  Satellite, Hunter - with Irwin and his American wife / colleague Terri - is a film children should enjoy.	0
It offers little of the current joys of pretty and weightless intellectual entertainment.	0
A succession of ridiculous shootings.	0
Nothing waking up in Reno has ever inspired me to see its residents as more than markers in a script.	0
I'm just too bored to care.	0
Irwin is a man with enough charisma and audacity to make a dozen films, but this particular result is ultimately discouraged from being something bigger.	0
No stereotype is left out, no cliché remains unsaid.	0
As its title suggests, this pipette with a pg-13 value is ultimately as threatening as the fabric softener.	0
The attempts of this ensemble film to convey a message are so clumsy that they overwhelm the audience.	0
It all feels like a Monty Python sketch.	0
Nerve breakdowns are not entertaining.	0
Scorsese doesn't give us a character worth talking about.	0
a beautifully made piece of uncontrollable noise.	0
like an eternal grimace party.   How can something so brutal be so boring?	0
It's so bad.	0
Even cinematic cleanliness needs a bit of gravity, beyond good hair and hump.	0
I was sad for lise less because of what happened than because she was captured by this film when she obviously belongs in something lighter and sunnier, for example by Rohmer.	0
Apart from clever toys, there is little to love about this little English treat.	0
This is the wreck of an action film - a baffling attempt by the filmmakers to squeeze James Bond into the mindless mold and throw 40 years of film history into the toilet in favour of bright flashes and loud bangs.	0
The film is flat when it should be at its peak, and is more of a missed opportunity and trifle than dark, decadent truffle.	0
It is played in the most straightforward way, with little humor to ease things. The clumsy film is therefore almost ridiculous.	0
"Van Wilder brings a whole new meaning to the term ""comedy gag. At least one scene is so disgusting that viewers might struggle to keep their lunch."	0
A disappointment for those who love alternative versions of the Bard, especially those involving fryers and hamburgers.	0
The film tries too hard to be funny and too hard to be hip. The end result is a film that is neither.	0
Every nanosecond of the new guy reminds you that you could do something much more pleasant. Something like toilet scrubbing. or drain rat traps. or make the last year's taxes with your ex-wife.	0
scooby dooby doo / and shaggy too / you look good and sound too. / but daphne, you're too buff / fred thinks he's tough / and velma - wow, you lost weight!	0
Is the time really right for a warmed-up James Bond adventure starring a village idiot as 007 clone?	0
There is enough melodrama in this magnolia primavera to make Pta proud, but the director's characters are less worthy of Puccini than daytime television.	0
However much it may please those who love movies that boast pop songs, young science fiction fans will run away disgusted.	0
the humor is not as sharp, the effects not as innovative, and the story not as imaginative as the original. But it could have been worse.	0
Some of her jokes work, but most fail miserably, and in the end the pumpkin is far more offensive than funny.	0
Even horror fans are unlikely to find what they're looking for every day; the film lacks both thrills and humour.	0
"The book ""Death"" comes across as a rejected abc after-school special, freshened up by the imbecile of a script class.    Instead, ""Crossroads"" provokes a handful of unintentional howls and numerous yawns."	0
It seems to me that the film is about the art of ripping people off without ever letting them know they've done it	0
It's just disappointingly superficial - a film that has all the elements needed for a fascinating character study, but never does more than scratch the surface.	0
The title describes not only its main characters, but also the lazy people behind the camera.	0
Sometimes it feels as if it was made in the 70s or 80s and cast with weird chases and Goldie Hawn movies.	0
Shaeffer has to find a hook on which to hang his stubbornly useless films, and it might as well be the revival of the medieval figure.	0
overwhelms most viewers.	0
The story drifts so relentlessly into clichés about tortured (and tortured) artists and consuming but impossible love that you can't help but be disappointed as each revised new sequence continues.	0
It is worth mentioning that the stage design and interior of the ghost ship are more than effectively creepy and atmospheric. So I did.	0
Shamelessly fussy and, worse, fleeing his own provocative subject.	0
Aggravating and tiring.	0
The ring just left me cold and wet, as if I were in the drizzle without rain gear.	0
the film seems to have an empty weight. The lack of pace kills them, though that would be entirely appropriate in a film about cancer.	0
For anyone who grew up on Disney's Treasure Island in 1950, or who remembers the 1934 classic pilot, he feels like a fraud.	0
a clinging, indulgent and arrogant travelogue and diatribes.   Well, just like that. Watching the scarlet diva, you're ready for temptations, raw insights or both. Instead, we just get messy rage, a movie as personal therapy.	0
Underwater mess: It's so bad that it's good, but only if you get involved in a commercial.	0
The end is a police operation. what happens to john q? I have no idea.	0
has the feel of an unedited personal journal.	0
Remember when Bond had more glamour than shouting? No longer.	0
and drop the dogs of cheese.	0
This charming nonsense comes amid clanking movie references that make jays and mute Bob's excellent adventure seem understated.	0
"It didn't quite deserve the gong, but there are more intriguing acts than ""confessions of a dangerous mind"""	0
the subject of swinging seems ripe for a documentary - only this one is not.	0
Hudlin is stuck trying to light a fire with wet leaves.	0
Unlike his directorial efforts, la femme nikita and the professional, the transporter lacks Besson's perspective as a narrator.	0
The overall effect is so utterly nonsensical that one would have to be mightily bored to even think of staying longer than, say, ten years.   Three minutes.	0
It lacks depth.	0
Most of the supporting characters in Ostwood's films are weak, as are most sub-plots. This one is weaker than most.	0
There is no real reason to see it and no real reason not to do it.	0
The audience will find no mention of political prisoners or persecutions that could paint the Castro regime in less than holy tones.	0
Subdued and lifeless	0
The film takes too long to get to the good stuff, and then too long to figure out what to do next.	0
You can practically smell the patchouli oil.	0
To say this is De Niro's best film since meeting his parents sums up the sad state of his recent career.	0
The actors do not live in their roles - they are trapped in them, forced to change their behaviour in bizarre, unjustified ways, and engage in dialogues that are mostly platitudes.	0
an often deadly boring, strange reading of a classic whose witty dialogues are treated with an astonishing nonchalance	0
This film was made to make the slowest person in the audience laugh - just pure slapstick with lots of harmless screams and exaggerated facial expressions.	0
The plot and jokes are too often made by far more talented people than Ali.	0
Another week later came another crass college.	0
Laughable, irredeemably awful.	0
Moderately rousing despite bargain basement photos and hackneyed romance.	0
there is no insight into the agony of Heidi's life - just a depiction of pain, today's version of the Greek tragedy, the talk show guest suing her fate.	0
The editing is chaotic, the photography grainy and poorly focused, the writing unintentionally hilarious, the direction unfocused, the performances wooden.	0
When [de palma] is bad, he is really bad, and femme fatale is one of the worst he has done.	0
The tadpole is a symbol of the mindless ageism that films suffer from: young is cool and too young is too cool.	0
I doubt anyone will remember the picture when Christmas really is over, but maybe it will be on video by then.	0
Unsure of tone.   A messed-up exercise in sexual politics, a short cut for very bad things.	0
All well and good, and rest assured, the awareness-raising lessons are packed with gags.	0
The only thing worse than your inferior, everyday Hollywood image is the fear-ridden attempt to be profound.	0
If you think Jennifer Lopez has displayed poor judgment in planning to marry Ben Affleck, wait until you see maid in Manhattan.	0
Stars like Matthew Perry and Eliza Hurley are more than giggles, and more jokes land than crash, but ultimately the service to Sara is no different from the herd	0
It is best to avoid being trapped with boring, nerdy people.	0
Culkin exudes no charm or charisma that would have even remotely interested a broader audience in his rugged character.	0
Ultimately, the director's only justification is a shared but unexplored fascination with the frustrated maniac.	0
(How) channel surfing between the discovery channel and a late-night action movie.	0
A film that more or less meanders through soggy Paris, rather than hopping along the Seine.	0
"Perhaps ""artistically"" shot by Joaquin Baca-asay with hand-held cameras and apparently without film light, the low-budget production teeters nervously between vertigo and opacity."	0
Imagine a really bad West Side Story production without the songs.	0
Soul is what every character in this film and thus the film itself lacks.	0
A one-trick pony whose few T & A bits still can't save him from being unoriginal, unfunny and unrecommendable.	0
The worst kind of independent; the one in which actors dress up and wriggle clumsily as they try to strike lightning bolts, as their 1970s predecessors did	0
It may be a prize winner, but Teacher is a bomb.	0
The production values are up there. The use of cgi and digital ink and ink makes things look really smooth. The voices are good, too. The problem is that most of these things are the script.	0
it has its heart in the right place, but withers after some time.	0
proves that a film about kindness is not the same as a good film.	0
Well, it goes on forever.	0
This overproduced and generally disappointing effort should not shake up rush hour.	0
Topkapi is not.	0
If Sheikh Mohammed wanted to tell a story about a man who is losing his faith, why didn't he just do it instead of using bad science fiction as a window dressing?	0
Ethan Hawke has always seen himself as the bastard child of the Beatnik generation, all over his Chelsea.	0
Even Parts Bodice-Ripper and Dumb Costume Drama	0
I'm not suggesting you actually watch it, unless you're the kind of person who has seen every Wim Wenders film of the 1970s.	0
While the film goes wrong on all levels, the biggest drawback is the lack of laughter in a comedy.	0
If you liked the 1982 film then, you will still like it today.	0
a 93-minute summary of a 26-part television series, with all the pitfalls you would expect.	0
Guillen rarely goes below the surface. She lists ingredients but never stirs.	0
It's safe to assume that viewers will only suspend their incredulity until now - and that doesn't include the 5 o'clock shadow on the big wooden child when it comes to school.	0
To imagine the life of the potter as a martial arts adventure told by a lobotomised woody Allen is to have an idea of the fate facing moviegoers lured into the mediocrity that is kung-fu: the fist.	0
It causes chills and persistent discomfort, but fails in its quest for deeper meanings.	0
The credibility level is low and character development is a foreign concept.	0
I'd rather have a transfer down to Lord's It was Robin Williams's class for the music, or Robin Williams's lecture, so I could listen to a teacher with humour, passion and verve	0
The ingredients are largely there. But Nettelbeck's unwillingness to go beyond the surfaces of her characters prevents them from coming together.	0
a serious, heartbreaking look at the gap between religious fundamentalists and their homosexual relatives. It is also clumsy and devotes too much time to bigoted views.	0
A chaotic, implausible platonic romance that makes Chaplin's city lights seem dispassionate by comparison.	0
Yes, we enjoy watching Joan grow from an awkward young woman into a strong, determined monarch, but her love of the philandering Philip only diminishes her size.	0
It's a film that depends on its cast, and Glover really doesn't fit the role.	0
This is a discarded junk food film whose rap soundtrack was better maintained than the movie.	0
With the candy-like flavor fading faster than 25-cent chewing gum, I realized that this is a throwaway film that won't work. It's a trifle.	0
Literally nothing in the pool is new, but anyone who grew up with the stalker movies of the 1980s should settle for 90 minutes.	0
Arguably the most stupid and incoherent film of the year.	0
For one reason or another, the scrum soon becomes a dark drama. After that, it just gets silly and maudlin. It's a shame, but thanks to some lovely comedic moments and some fine performances, it's not total loss.	0
Chao was a cagey assistant in China for years. He didn't learn that movies are about telling.	0
A mixture of a comedy that can't really be of this world.	0
Bulky device.	0
The film is a travesty of the genre and takes itself too seriously as a parody.	0
combines the amateurishness of the Blair Witches project with the illogic of the seventh series: the contenders for a completely stark and unforgettable film.	0
The Piano Teacher is the kind of film that keeps American audiences from ever seeing a foreign film again.	0
If it's another action movie you like, there's no better movie than Half a Sixpence.	0
So what's the point? Lovingly choreographed bloodshed in a pristine netherworld, basically.	0
This is junk food cinema at its best.	0
When everything is wet, it's fun. But when it's dry, this surfer-girl melodrama begins to snap like a stranded grouper.	0
Most new films have a bright sheen. Some, like ballistic, come stillborn.   , which looks like the worn-out video box cover of seven years.	0
The story is poignant, of course, but first-time screenwriter Paul Pender overloads it with sugary business bits.	0
you see robert de niro singing - and dancing - west side story show tunes Choose your reaction: a.) That's certainly funny!  It's pathetic!	0
A sermonising and lifeless declaration of love to teenage fools.	0
This dramatically shaky contest of willpower merely repeats the old Hollywood saw: Evil is interesting and good boring.	0
Soon after, the film begins to play like a hospital traversed by a Saturday live spoof of Dog Day.	0
The charm of deliberate eccentricity, at least as this latest cinematic essay proves, is beginning to wane a little.	0
Rather than tell a terrible true story, the film is determined to be the next Texas chainsaw massacre. But what about the countless other people who just want to see a solid story about a universally interesting soul?	0
A silly, revelatory film about a silly, revelatory director.	0
Scarlet Diva has a voyeuristic tug, but all in all she's much less sensational than she wants to be.	0
The character is too forced and over-written to be funny or credible most of the time, and clay doesn't always enhance the exaggerated mix.	0
Shrill, pretentious and as impenetrable as Morvern's thick working-class Scottish accent.	0
A battle between cheek theatre and matinee.	0
The film is virtually without context - journalistic or historical. Worse, Pelosi knows it.	0
"Instead, go rent ""Shakes the Clown,"" a much funnier film with a similar theme and an equally great performance by Robin Williams."	0
Lame, haphazard teen comedy.	0
"It's the kind of film that ends up gracing U.  Art House Screens for no other reason than the fact that it is in French (well, mostly) with English subtitles and therefore magically ""significant."""	0
This pathetic excuse from a film runs empty because you think the flat-bush machismo will prevail.	0
You expect to be reminded of other, better films, especially seven that director William Malone slavishly copies.	0
The film is crammed with dance, henna, ornaments and group singing, but its narrative clichés and telegraphed episodes smell like old soap operas.	0
It's getting harder and harder to ignore the fact that Hollywood isn't laughing with us. it laughs at us.	0
might have done better as a documentary, with less of Mr. Eyre's uninspired drama and more of his sense of observation and outrage.	0
Every good actor has to play his part. For Benigni, it was Pinocchio, not Shakespeare, that defined his career It might as well have been a problem child.	0
Arnold's leap from the small screen to the big screen will leave frowns on some faces.	0
terrible and attractive at the same time.	0
The lack of opposing viewpoints quickly becomes tiresome - the film feels more like a series of toasts at a testimonial dinner than a documentary.	0
Nothing is worth sending home.	0
What remains is a superficial snapshot that, engaging as it may be, is not revealing and inviting enough.	0
Helmer Devito.   tries to do too many things in this story about ethics, payola, vice, murder, children's television and revenge.	0
It would not be my preferred way to spend 100 minutes or $7.	0
I hated every minute of it.	0
The same extremes prevent us from taking his message seriously, and the stepwives mentality does not work in a modern context.	0
obvious politics and rudimentary animations reduce the chances of attracting hey arnold! The film will go far beyond its core demographic.	0
It is clear that this hybrid is missing the impact of the Disney classic and even the excellent MGM version of 1934.	0
A simple, sometimes insanely slow film that has just enough charm and good acting to make it interesting, but is ultimately swept away by the pace and lack of creativity.	0
Rob Mitchell, who has done an appealing job as a director and Notting Hill in England, becomes too artistic in his American debut.	0
There is an almost poignant dimension to the way each great stunt gull plays its character.   The film is shot from behind, as if it could make us believe that we are not seeing a double.	0
Anthony Hopkins? Big business! We've already seen the prequel to Silence of the Lambs and The Hannibal - and it was better the first time.	0
On the face of it, it celebrates the power of middle-aged girls, even if it portrays friendship between women as pathetic, dysfunctional and damaging.	0
If this is an example of the kind of project Robert Redford's lab is willing to put its stamp on, then perhaps it's time to rethink independent films.	0
The pumpkin sits somewhere between listless Solondzien satire and quiet student film.	0
It's less funny than aggressively sitcom-sweet, full of throwaway one-liners, not-so-funny jokes and a determined TV kindness that embodies everyone.	0
It's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film, because it isn't. It's just incredibly boring.	0
The sad thing about the bypass men is their lame attempt to capture the coolness vibes, when in reality the film isn't as frivolous or smooth as it thinks.	0
A ponderous and clichéd film, smeared with every emotion known to man.	0
Director Ferzan Ozpetek creates an interesting dynamic with the members of this group who live in the same apartment building. But he loses his focus when he focuses on one person.	0
Egoyan's film is too complicated to get involved in, and, if you excuse a little critical heresy, too intellectually ambitious.	0
It wants to be seen as a subversive little indie film, but it has all the qualities of a modern situation comedy.	0
Despite obvious motives to the contrary, the end, like [Seinfeld's] revered TV show, is about almost nothing.	0
Shadyac shoots his film like an M Night Shyamalan film, and he often maintains the same snail's pace; he just forgot to add real tension.	0
plays less like a coming-of-age romance than like an infomercial.	0
There are a few laughs and clever gags, but not enough to make it more than another big-budget bust.	0
The story is so absurd that, despite the best efforts of everyone involved, I did not believe it for a second.	0
I've heard that the fans of the first men in black hate the second. I wonder why. They seemed like the same movie.	0
Despite their relentless vibe and sinuous facial symmetry, Witherspoon is just too high to be America's sweetheart.	0
An indie debut with an extremely low budget, which is more in keeping with good intentions than talent.	0
Birot is a competent filmmaker, but there is nothing fresh or exciting about her story.	0
de niro and mcdormand give solid performances, but their screen time is sabotaged by the story's inability to spark interest.	0
Even single-digit age groups will see that this story is too stupid.   even for Disney.	0
That is what the panels essentially lack - a sense of something bigger, a final point.	0
A compendium of Solondz's worst instincts in under 90 minutes.	0
"If the title is a threat question, the answer might be: ""How does Steven Seagal get across these days?"" Or maybe ""how will you feel after an 88-minute demolition of the rock with action limited to slo-mo gunfire and random shards of glass?"	0
It's a comedy that's not very funny, and an action movie that's not very exciting (and a troubled alliance, too).	0
The story is familiar from its many predecessors; like them, it culminates in the not-so-breathtaking realization that crimes don't pay.	0
You have more fun setting yourself alight in the parking lot. You will have more fun being caught by a bus.	0
Demonising a Bond film is like calling a dog stupid, but if it has the temerity to run for two hours, you feel like you're getting a kick.	0
Ritchie's treatment of class reversal is largely cerebral, from the repetitive manifestos thrown in people's faces over and over again to the fact that Amber is such a joke.	0
flat but with a revealing performance from Michelle Williams	0
little more than a foaming vanity project	0
The film develops from an unusual science fiction character study to a chase movie that distracts from the end.	0
Verbinski replaces atmosphere with action, boredom with tension.	0
Despite all the superficial fury, high crimes should be accused of loitering - so much to see, so little to offer.	0
The sum total of all fears is hard to fathom - and there is something creepy about seeing an American football stadium as pop entertainment.	0
Alex Nohe's documentary plays like a travelogue for something that largely resembles a real, big-budget version of tank girls.	0
"The title ""Fallen"" turns out to be a fairly fair description of how you feel while watching this ultra manipulative thriller."	0
The allure of vulgar, sexist, racist humour went over my head or - considering how low my forehead sits - it might sneak under my feet.	0
History really has no place because Simeone does not understand that it cannot deliver conflict.	0
There's not that much syrup.	0
For the most part, I was an amusing lark, probably one of Murphy's better performances in one of his less-lauded films.	0
"focuses on Joan's angry hormones and enrages the audience with Spanish questions about her ""madness"" so much that I waste 123 minutes and 9 dollars. 50 on this 21st century torture device."	0
This series should have died a long time ago, but they keep bringing it back to another day as a punishment for paying money to see the last James Bond movie.	0
A bit bulky.	0
With a story as bizarre and mysterious as this one, you don't want to worry whether the ineffectual broom field will have the courage to knock on that door.	0

The film feels great, and it feels like that for a long time to come, but it just never happens.	0

It's hard, astringent, darkly funny and.   Well, it's also general, messy, patronising and mild by nature.	0
It's mostly a fan artifact.	0
There is no denying the depth of the artist's concepts and his ability to depict them with outrageous panache, but in reality the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense, lavishly praised by those who equate darkness with depth.	0
Characters wander into predictably treacherous situations when they should know better.	0
Guillermo del Toro's sequel to the 1998 hit has plenty of style, but why do we need 117 minutes to tell a story that simply lasts no more than 90 minutes?	0

The reluctance of the first director João Pedro Rodrigues to define the background or motivations of his hero becomes increasingly frustrating as the film progresses.	0
No reason for anyone to invest their hard-earned money in a film that obviously hasn't invested much in itself.	0
a strong first quarter, slightly less the second quarter and an average second half.	0
A boring, twitchingly sweet and disgustingly politically correct cartoon that's guaranteed to drive anyone over the age of four out of the theatre screaming.	0
The vampire thriller Blade II starts out as a wild scream and then sucks the blood out of its fun towards the end, you can feel the veins crawling from the training.	0

So few films deal with religion that it is disappointing to reduce it to an idea that fits into a cloth.	0
It is also clear from the start that the van runs on adrenaline only, and as soon as the initial high subsides, the film's shortcomings begin to become apparent.	0
It's more like watching a long soap opera where only the first episode was good.	0
It's fun, but a psychological mess, with austin forces knocking his head out on the way out.	0
There are touching moments in Etoiles, but for the most part this is a boring, sombre documentary about something that should be a joyous, or at least fascinating, subject.	0
Exaggerated, melodramatic bodice ripper.	0
Could the whole plan have been here to produce something that, by comparison, looks like a classic? That is the only reasonable reason I can think of for the existence of a swimming fan.	0
I didn't laugh at the constant efforts of Dice and his skinny buddy mike epps to make like laurel and hardy'n the hood.	0
The only way this supernatural snoring festival could give anyone a case of horror is if they were euthanized by the film and had a nightmare.	0
I wonder how the Israelis react to this supposedly balanced presentation.	0
The film would work much better as a video installation in a museum where the audience could walk freely. Immediately.	0
Human nature succeeds first by allowing itself to be driven crazy, but ultimately fails by getting out of control.	0
[It's] a prison football movie with charismatic, tough guys, but it had too much spit for me to enjoy.	0

The long-awaited and lacklustre film.	0
It's just a different genre.	0
Each story in itself could have been expanded and turned into a compelling feature film, but in its current incarnation, storytelling never quite gets over its one-sided concept.	0
The only bright spot is William Bruchner as a pompous professor.	0
A banal psychological thriller that aims to keep the audience guessing - not to be confused with suspicion - until it's time to finish things and send the audience home.	0
Neither funny nor exciting nor particularly drawn.	0
'Carente de imaginación, mal dirigida, peor actuada y sin un ápice de romance, es una verdadera pérdida de tiempo y diner'	0
"Acting, especially by Tambor, makes ""never again"" worthwhile, but [writer / director] Schaeffer should follow his advice"	0

"I kept thinking, ""I should enjoy this."" But I wasn't."	0
as from Lord. Schäffer, Christopher and Grazie are little more than a collection of quirky character traits that are ripped from the outline of a screenwriter and thrown at actors charged with the impossible task of making them fail.	0
Like so many other supposedly scary films, it twists and turns in such a way that it drains energy from the very audience it seeks to scare.	0
The main problem in Orange County is that, having created an unusually lively set of characters worthy of its strong cast, the film stumbles when it comes to giving them something.	0
Just like Hearst's huge yacht, it is slow and bulky and takes a long time to reach its destination.	0
There is no character in the film with a glimmer of plausibility, no credible event, no confrontation that is not staged, no moment that is not false.	0
Where jokes from Cho's life story flowed most recently, offering a riveting dramaturgy, the comedian hides behind obviously constructed routines.	0
Why come up with anything remotely original when you can plunder from Shirley Jackson, Richard Matheson?   and puke something like pink?	0
A broad-based, profound comedy in which the actors deliver mildly amusing performances and no farm animals are hurt by the gags.	0
Too cruel to be a comedy, and too silly to be an effective horror film.	0
There is a lack of heart, depth and, above all, determination.	0
Though a bit of a patchwork in script and production, a shiny, lush green setting almost makes the picture work.	0
absolutely pleasant, instantly memorable, nothing to write home about.	0
Wasabi is light fare, with the whole project feeling like something is thrown off fast (like one of Huber's beats), but popcorn should be smooth enough.	0

This ill-fitting tuxedo is strictly off the rack.	0
"Is ""ballistic"" worth the price of admission? Absolutely not. It sucked. would I see it again? see previous answer."	0

The film, which is part comedy, part drama, in the end achieves neither goal completely and leaves us touched and amused by some moments and ideas, but still dissatisfied with the film overall.	0
divinely boring snail of a movie.	0
Bored, if not without wit, this shaggy dog longs to wander the alleys of history, but manages little more than a modest, slumbering charm.	0
Scene by scene, things happen, but you'd struggle to tell what or why.	0
is an unimaginative, nasty, slightly cynical work.	0
It's a pretty awful film by conventional standards.   But it's also strangely fascinating, a pre-made Eurotrash cult object. Sometimes it is also strangely moving.	0
The tug-of-war over the heart of the Beijing bicycle is burdened by agonizing finesse, overheated pathos and long, wistful glances.	0
Wicked and sticky are the two best adjectives for ghost ship.	0
Some decent actors do great damage to their reputation.	0
As the great-grandson of the author, you'd think filmmaker Simon Brunnen would be more in awe of the material. But this expensive dud is a far cry from the book or the beloved movie.	0

Accuracy and realism are great, but when the film gets boring and the dialogue is not clever, you have to use more poetic freedom.	0
For all its pompous titles and corkscrew narrative, the film turns out to be little more than a shaggy human story.	0
A soggy, clichéd horror epic even dumber than its title.	0
One groaning familiarity creates another.	0
Although based on a real person, John is a rather boring person in the film, and you have to stick with him for two hours.	0

Great story, bad idea for a movie.	0
with Agent Children 2: The Island of Lost Dreams author / director / producer Robert Rodriguez has cobbled together a film that feels like sugar gone out of control.	0

If you collected all the moments of coherent dialogue, they would still not yield the time needed to boil a four minute egg.	0
Despite all the talk until the bloody climax, we still don't feel enough attachment to these guys to take care of one way or another.	0
Just as mendacious as most live-action Disney family movies - no real plot, no real conflict, no real meaning.	0
A sensual performance by Abbass underpins the flimsy story, but her inner journey is largely unexplored and we marvel at this exotic-looking woman whose emotional depth is only implied.	0
never engaged, absolutely predictable and completely devoid of anything remotely interesting or exciting.	0
Marriage abuse is a big problem in today's society, but the film reduces this domestic tragedy to flourishing melodrama.	0
oedekerk wrote Patch-Adams, which should not be forgiven. Why he had free rein over this project - he wrote, directed, acted and produced - is beyond me.	0
The creaky, rusty ship forms a beautiful backdrop, but the ghost haunts you.	0

She tries too hard and goes beyond the logic of her own world.	0
The whole damn thing is ripe for the Jerry Springer. It's all pretty cynical and patronising.	0

What would happen if Orwell, Bradbury, Kafka, George Lucas and the Wachowski brothers were thrown into the mixer? But that's the problem - the director hasn't added enough of his own ingredients.	0
with the recent tensions reignited by the kathleen soliah trial and the upcoming trial of sla members emily and william harris, not to mention the Sept. 11, it is difficult to see the bright side of fire today.	0

"With dialogues like ""you come from two different worlds"" and ""tonight the maid is a lie and this is who you are,"" this castle-filled fairy tale reaches new depths of unoriginality and predictability."	0
Too slow, too boring and sometimes annoying.	0
is there enough material to deserve a documentary about the making of William's last album?	0
impeccably professional, but ultimately easy.	0
Schmaltzy and unfunny, Adam Sandler's caricature of Hanukkah is deafeningly bad, a bit too bad, 10 worst lists.	0
It really is another anaemic and formulaic buddy cop movie that tries to portray its lack of imagination as hip.	0

julia is played with annoying ruthlessness by laura regan	0
Morrissey's script and direction show plenty of intelligence and wit - but not much.	0
There's a suspension of disbelief and then there's bad scripts.   This film grabs a wallop from the latter.	0
All ms. Jovovich must look radiant, grimly purposeful and gently alarmed as a saintly heroine as he imposes doors, swings wrenches and flees monsters.	0
Mocking kung fu pictures when they were a staple of exploitative theatre programming were funny. Mocking them now is an exercise in futility.	0
This is a particularly poisonous little candy that only a select few and very yellowish-haired people like.	0
This is not just the cliffnotes version of nicholas nickleby, it is the cliffnotes that are missing.	0
Given the rough locations and demanding stunts, this must have been a difficult shoot, but the film also proved difficult for the audience.	0
Better sleep than a sound machine.	0
so clichéd that at one point they literally tip over an apple cart.	0
It is a decent insight into a time and an outcast who is no longer accessible, but does not necessarily shed more light on his subject than the popular predecessor.	0
It could be the first science fiction comedy to benefit from a trio-style laugh number.	0
When the plot begins, the film loses credibility.	0
Credibility sinks into the swamp of emotions.	0
The film takes itself too seriously and as a result is only occasionally fun.	0
[davis] has a bright, choppy style that keeps things moving, while never quite managing to connect her wish-fulfilling characters with the human race.	0

Bullock's total lack of concentration and ability quickly derails the film	0
So stupid, so ill thought out, so poorly drawn, it created whole new levels of ugliness.	0
The truth is that the truth about Charlie is becoming ever more damning.	0
Permanent love, but exhausting cinema.	0
Some of Seagal's action images are guilty pleasures, but this one is so formulaic that it feels like on autopilot.	0
A ponderous meditation on love that feels considerably longer than its relatively paltry 97 minutes.	0
A long-winded and staged session of romantic tricks that never really looks like the smart feminist fairy tale it could be.	0
A bit too much for your own good.	0
There are films that test the patience of even the most cinema-obsessed critic - and this was one of them.	0
Seeing trouble every day, at least if you don't know what's coming, is like biting into a juicy, delicious plum on a hot summer's day and getting away with a mouth full of rotten flesh and live worms.	0
As well-intentioned as she is, her soap opera morality stories have the antiseptic, pre-programmed feel of an extracurricular special.	0
What would Jesus do if he were a director? He would make a movie better.	0
If it turns out that a series of guidelines that a director has devised for his actors before shooting is smarter, better written and of considerable interest than the finished film, that is a bad sign. A very bad sign.	0
It is a deeply serious film, passionately interested in its subject, but all too often it becomes ponderous in its teaching of history or gets lost in the complicated connections and complex timelines of its story.	0
can not upset the gathered talent and the Russos show real potential as comic filmmakers. Still, this thing feels flimsy and fleeting.	0
The window shines unfaithfully. Almost everything else is nonsense.	0
I'm afraid you won't get over this frankly fantastic By the Numbers B flick with a degree of disbelief. Instead, wrestle to the ground in disbelief and then apply the chloroform-soaked handkerchief.	0
so relentlessly healthy that I wanted to delete something.	0
the title helpfully offers the most succinct review you can read anywhere.	0
The makers of the divine mysteries of the Ya-ya Sisterhood should offer a free pass (second prize, of course, two free tickets) to anyone who can find a truly honest moment in their film.	0
God help the poor woman when Attal is so uncertain in real life: the neuroses of his fictional Yvan are sufficiently aggravating to exhaust the patience of even the most understanding spouse.	0
Let's get back to consumer advice: stay at home.	0
Undercover brother doesn't go far enough. It's just a silly black parody.	0
The implicit premise of the film is that the faith of the Tonga people is inferior to John's in every way.	0
"An ""e"" stands for effort - and a ""b"" for boredom."	0
You've seen the heartbreak of seeing the far superior Nurse Betty or the Boulevard of Sunset. Even the uncontrollable soap dish is more original.	0
"plays like one of those conversations the comic guy has about ""The Simpsons."""	0
A journey too random and inconclusive to be convincing, but almost worth Hoffman's brilliance.	0
the film jumps across the map.	0
"But with bogus truths and routine ""indie"" filmmaking, he has made another sure film. It's not terrible, just terribly mediocre."	0
This strange mixture of crime fiction, quirky character study, third-rate romance and female empowerment fantasy never really finds the sound or thematic glue it needs.	0
"""Juwanna man?"" No thanks. We actually want money back."	0
It's a sometimes interesting remake that doesn't compare to the brilliant original.	0
They are too aware of the effort needed to be so spontaneous.	0
Simple.	0
King, who is trying honestly, and Schwartzman, who shot himself in the foot, feel bad.	0
Some actors steal scenes. Tom Green just gives them a bad smell. This self-absorbed do-gooder is far from the only thing wrong with the heavy-handed comedy that steals the show, but he is the most obvious.	0
Sometimes fond memories should remain in the past: a lesson this film teaches all too well.	0
The enormous comic potential of an oafish idiot impersonating an aristocrat is sadly unrecognised.	0
Flat.	0
begins as a promising meditation on one of America's most enduring obsessions, but ends as a slim cinematic stunt.	0
A monster fighting thriller as impersonal in its relentlessness as the video game series that inspired it.	0
Proof that a thriller can be elegantly shot, expertly cast and played with crisp professionalism.   and would still be a disappointment if their twists and turns were not more surprising than the weather forecast yesterday.	0
The reason we see the same movie every year with about the same people is because so many of us carry on and then, out of shame or stupidity, warn no one.	0
There's not much going on in this film, unless you decide to just get into the idea that something inexplicably strange happened once in a while.	0
In the second half of the film Frei loses control in direct relation to the time he gives to self-analysis.	0
"Director Barry Skolnick and his screenwriters tick every point of the ""longest yard"" like a check list."	0
The furious coherence that [deniro] brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the film itself, which, as it trots along toward the end, feels less like a film than like a filmed reading of a script that needs polishing.	0
Oh, that's extreme, all right. Extremely stupid. Extremely confusing. Extremely boring.	0
We never really feel connected to history, because all its ideas remain exactly that: abstract ideas.	0
"For a shooting ""em-up, ballistic is strangely lifeless."	0
One minute you're looking at a serious action player; the next it's as if clips of the Pink Panther have been spliced in.	0
What happened to the Pluto-Nash? How was it ever made?	0
We may never see the band camp as geeky or nerdy again.	0
"The film ""The Story of a Soldier"" begins as promisingly as any war / adventure film you'll ever see, and dissolves into a routine court drama."	0
The result is solemn and terrifying, but strangely aloof.	0
These spiders can run off a motorcycle in seconds and wrap a person in a sticky cocoon, but they are neither interesting nor entertaining.	0
A less thrilling thriller.	0
A long haul for everyone but the most dedicated Pokemon fan.	0
Matt McConaughey tries to control the screen with swaggering machismo and exaggerated madness and fails.	0
How on earth did director Ron Underwood manage to spend $100 million?	0
Everyone associated with this film seems to be part of an insider clique that tends to produce formulaic rather than fresh films.	0
With a story inspired by the turbulent Los Angeles environment, where every dreamer with a burst bubble feels marginalized, the handler has a few characters and ideas, but he never manages to get them the same way.	0
His lack of quality earns him a place alongside the other two Dumas botched jobs of recent times, the man with the iron mask and the musketeer	0
a harmless but unforgettable science fiction variety.	0
The plot grinds to a grinding halt.	0
It's never a good sign when the movie star spends the entire movie in a coma. It's a worse sign when you start to envy her condition.	0
It doesn't help that director and cinematographer Kasmierski shot on grunting video, which gives the whole thing a dirty, tasteless feel.	0
Desperately unfunny when he tries to make us laugh, and desperately unexciting when he tries to jump us from our seats.	0
The film's relationship to actual tension is the same as what a Christmas tree floating in a spray can is to actual snow: a bad - albeit permanent - imitation.	0
John McEnroe's botched remake may be subtler than Norman Jewison's ultra-violent 1975 futuristic corporate sports saga It's also stupid.	0
Director Richard Shafer and co-writer Greg Hinton ride the dubious dividing line where gay porn reaches for serious drama.	0
borrows from so many literary and cinematic sources that this future world is experiencing absolute déjà vu.	0
The more depressing [the characters] become, the more tiring the story becomes, especially as it continues to strive strikingly to be profound.	0
The acting of the over 25s lacks the spark, with the Csokas particularly disconnected.	0
Although Howard is a great director, this southern gothic drama is, alas, a hard sell, with an underdeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and clumsy metaphors to suffocate a horse - or at least slow it down to a canter.	0
is shaken when it takes itself too seriously and when it depends too much on its otherwise talented cast to become a clown in situations that are not funny.	0
The fight scenes are fun, but it gets boring.	0
Anyone who can count to five (target audience of the film?) can see where this stupid brew is going.	0
None of this turns out to be funny or provocative - just boring.	0
Demme's relaxed approach kills the tension.	0
This idea has lost its originality.   And neither star seems particularly excited when it comes to warming up what is essentially a one-sided picture.	0
[Set] broadly as a middle-aged buddy comedy.	0
The film itself is a kind of cinematic high crime, one that keeps the dramas in military courts very, very low.	0
Nothing more than a mediocre little thing.	0
A sultry little history lesson, humourless and boring.	0
Too stupid to spread fear, too stoic to be funny, it projects the same lazy affability as its nominal star, David Arquette.	0
If Cameron Diaz were kept in a cage with her monkey, he would mate her in his latest case.	0
Trivial where it should be profound and hyper-clichéd where it should be honest.	0
It would be hard to imagine a new movie that has worked so hard to achieve this little fun.	0
Why put someone who ultimately doesn't learn at the center of a children's story?	0
All the (Powerpuff girls) charm is there in the movie, but it's too thin.	0
sometimes clever, but often secondary	0
The ill-conceived modern ending falls flat where it should deliver a moral blow.	0
Collateral damage, despite its supposed provocation after 9 / 11, is ultimately a matter of history. As well as his star, his attitude and his forgetting.	0
It hesitates and drags when it should bang; it does not even have the virtue of brainless violence to break the boredom of all its generational connections.	0
His message of saving the planet clashes with his crass marketing.	0
a great idea becomes a not great movie	0
This film almost provoked me to take my own life. And if the Oscars win best picture, I could.	0
In the end I was looking for something heavy to beat myself with.	0
Not a film, but an agitprop cartoon in live action, so shameless and crude that it is almost comic.	0
feels like six different films fighting for attention.	0
Life is a pot - or something like that.	0
by jackasses for jackasses.	0
Despite a powerful performance by Binoche, it is a period romance that suffers from an exaggerated pace and an uneven narrative dynamic.	0
The picture is a guide to what happens when a lack of know-how mixes with lack of skill.	0
Bartleby is a one-off, and a bad joke.	0
Parody without limits.	0
Given that both films expect us to stand up for convicted violent criminals, not those who are supposed to protect us from them, we need every ounce of compassion that the disadvantages can bring.	0
A bravura exercise in the void.	0
Tail must spin in his grave, along with my stomach.	0
despite the premise of a good story.   She squanders all her star power on clichéd or meaningless roles.	0
All prints of this film should be sent to Pluto and buried there.	0
The film not only does not make us part of its reality, but also the most basic relevance test.	0
First good, then annoying. Outstanding Acting Performance and Direction.	0
This silly gangster yarn never really stands out from being another serious generic crime-fighting vehicle - a well-intentioned remake that shows some spunk and promise, but doesn't register as something distinctive or bold	0
It's hard to say whether the tuxedo is more boring or more embarrassing - I'm prepared to call it a draw.	0
Even if lame horror movies go, it's lame.	0
so routine, familiar and predictable that it raises the possibility that it has written itself as a newly automated computer program.	0
The Sunshine State lacks the kind of dynamism that Limbo offers, and is in some ways a rather indulgent piece.	0
even legends like alfred hitchcock and john huston staged occasional pettiness.   So it is no surprise to see a world-class filmmaker like Zhang Yimou behind the camera working for a yarn that is ultimately irrelevant.	0
a long-winded, predictable scenario.	0
Too close to the phantom threat for comfort.	0
Silly humbug.	0
Although trying to reconcile self-referential humor and a normal ol'slasher plot might seem like a decent endeavor, the result satisfies neither die-hard Jason fans nor those who understand good jokes.	0
Too clunky and too busy to really enjoy yourself.	0
This film is about lying, cheating, but loving the friends you betray.	0
It smacks of purely commercial motivation, without much love for the original.	0
Melanie eventually gobbles up the Yankee. It's just a shame the former Murphy Brown doesn't bring Reese back.	0
at the bottom rung of the entries of the series.	0
A real nuisance. a well-made, well-thought-out, well-acting scoop, but still a scoop.	0
A dismal rip-off of Goodfellas that serves as a muddled and offensive warning to Hispanic Americans.	0
The picture, which is occupied by a perversely cheerful Marcus Müller accordion / harmonica / banjo abomination, is a monument to evil in all its flourishing diversity.	0
"Good for a few unintentional laughs, ""extreme ops"" was obviously made for the ""xxx"" crowd, people who enjoy pointless action without the benefit of decent acting, writing and directing."	0
A big, baggy, sprawling carnival of a film that spreads before us without rhyme or reason.	0
a frustrating combination of tense humour and heavy-handed sentimentality.	0

, the creators have abandoned the entertaining elements of the original and instead refreshed old jokes and left all life at the door. I like the pug.	0
A reserved Ribisi is convincing as an Italian, although, if anything, a film needed one of the actor's tearful sayings to pump it up, which must be rare.	0
A second assassin shot? Moot Point.	0
a hysterical yet humourless discussion on the fine line between sucking face and literally sucking face	0
Of course, the drama that follows is completely crazy.	0
The problem is that this premise is not dramatised. Deslekhin is content to say it.	0
Madonna's still not licking.	0
Even the imaginative Gore can't hide the musty smell of Todd Farmer's screenplay, which is a simple retread of the 1979 alien, with a brave heroine fighting a monster in a spaceship.	0
If you lower your expectations to an all-time low, you could do worse than this strangely jolly - but not particularly funny - body-changing farce.	0
The episodic film makes a valid case for the depersonalisation of modern life. But the characters tend to be clichés whose lives are never fully explored.	0
Serry succeeds brilliantly in capturing the climate of the time and, perhaps unconsciously, connecting it with what happened in America in 2002. But it's hard to believe that the twists and turns of the plot derail the film in its final half hour.	0
Don't let your holiday spirit go that far.	0
Although the book is only about 300 pages long, it is so densely packed.   that even an ambitious adaptation and elaborate production like Mr. Schepisi's seems meager and unclear.	0

Intended as a relationship comedy, this wretched work falls flat in pretty much every conceivable area.	0
Sensitive, if not exactly revealing, documentation.	0
Director Brian Levant, who never strays far from his sitcom roots, slips cheerfully from one implausible situation to the next, pausing only to tie loose ends with more bows than you'll find on a French poodle.	0
Perhaps the heaviest, most joyless film of all time about the power of giant dragons over the world	0

"Films like this sell the old European openness, the old wink of ""bold"" revelation. But in 2002, such revelations wilted."	0
The timing in almost every scene seems lukewarm.	0
I admire it but I cannot recommend it because it exceeds its natural term.	0
A rather incidental mix of action and romance with a dash of deliberate and unintended comedy.	0
fails because of the general feeling that no one working on the production had exactly the same idea.	0
Even if you have the feeling that you have seen this film a thousand times, it is especially pleasant thanks to Belushi's light-hearted sympathy.	0
The story descends into a chaos of aimless violence.	0
Despite a few sips, the film is a blurry embrace.	0
McKay defuses his piece of buffoonery with a sour cliche and a high dose of meanness	0
A recipe for cinematic disaster.   Sometimes Quentin Tarantino, sometimes Ritchie and sometimes 1960s spy spoof - all bad.	0
the cumulative effect of the relentless horror on the parade paralyzes the power of film as drama.	0
Another big, silly action movie in the style of xxx, the van is riddled with plot holes big enough for its titular hero to drive his sleek black BMW.	0
Aaliyah rarely dampens her diva personality enough to spark real chemistry with Townsend. When she speaks, her creepy Egyptian demigod voice is as computer-processed and over-produced as in her music.	0
Monstrous is all that seemed to be this time. we miss the whimsical wonder that was once an integral part of the ride.	0
"Much of what is meant to be ""inspiring"" and ""uplifting"" is simply distasteful to viewers who don't share the film's mentality."	0
Long before it's over, Beijing bicycle begins to turn its wheels.	0
Home Alone Goes Hollywood, a funny premise until the kids start doing stunts that not even Steven Spielberg can. Besides, real film producers aren't that nice.	0
[Nelson's] film about morally compromised characters makes viewers feel compromised, unable to find their way out of the fog and ashes.	0
Passion, lip-syncing, tragedy and lots of really high notes. For me, this opera is not a favourite, so it takes a long time for the fat lady to sing.	0

Even die-hard fans of Japanese animation.   will find this a challenge.	0
Filmmakers have to dig deep to sink that low. Fortunately for all involved, this film will disappear as quickly as an ice cube thrown into a pot of boiling water.	0
The film becomes silent and routine.	0
The question of faith is not studied very intensively	0
It is a bad sign to wait for the film to hurry up and reach the death of its subjects just so that the documentary is over, but it is telling how unconvincing the film is, unless it happens to deal with its particular area of interest.	0
The situations and jokes are as predictable and profound as the endless pads the boys wear in their high heels.	0
It's frustrating to see these guys - who are obviously pretty smart - waste their talent on parodies of things they probably found funniest when they were high.	0
I was amazed as I watched it unfold with an astonishing lack of passion or originality.	0
K-19 may not hold much water as a submarine epic, but even less if it turns into an elegiac soggy private ryanovich.	0

A common haunted house story broadcast on the high seas.	0
elicits more groans from the audience than glass binders, junk-ripe doo and Scooby-stupid, all in one.	0
It's poorly acted, bluntly staged and could have been written by someone who has just finished primary school.	0
The white oleander is not a novel adaptation. It's a shrill, star-shaped reduction.	0
"This film starring Anthony Hopkins and Chrysi Rock is your typical ""fish out of water"" story. You've seen it a million times. Only one problem: fish from the water usually die. It does."	0
The timid, affluent, indulgent characters are crunchy rather than engaging.	0
a soggy, shapeless chaos.   Just a silly excuse for an equivalent of a ghost movie.	0
Men in black have it hard. A clumsy, comedic B-movie rush job.	0
A combination of standard, stiff TV animation and chic-looking digital effects that do little to disguise the fact that the characters barely move.	0
An unsatisfactory mixture of black witch and typical slash diet, in which the most conservative protagonist is always the last living.	0
Saying that for the soundtrack drowns out the lousy dialogue.	0
After seeing her swept away, I feel sorry for Madonna.	0
Instead of setting in motion the intrigue and tension and mystery of the whole, the war begins like war. He rams the Super Bowl, waits until after halftime to get started.	0
Two-bit boiler.	0
A sip of it is so sickly sweet that even the eager consumers of the pasteurized moors absorb it like rancid crème brûlée.	0
We were expecting a loud and melodramatic piece. We're not boring.	0
never quite exceeded the wild card status.   And the punchline doesn't do justice to Barry's dead-eyed, perfectly chilled speech.	0
The film's pathos often overwhelm what could have been a more diverse look at this interesting time and place.	0
It's almost like Solaris, but with guns and jokes.	0
A mysterious misfire and possibly the weakest film [Woody Allen] has made in twenty years.	0
It won't be long before you spy on me in a video store near you.	0
This film looks like it was produced in 1954, put on hold for 48 years and repackaged for an audience in 2002.	0
Not through figures, but through caricatures.	0
There is not a single ounce of honesty in the entire production.	0
This extremely unfunny film lasts 80 minutes but feels twice as long	0
Serious, but down to earth.   A slow, muddy, soporific, visually arresting crime melodrama / character study that would be more at home on the small screen but for its excellent cast.	0
The central narrative point is so mature that the film can't help but become soft and smelly.	0
For all his supposed youthful fire, Xxx is no less submissive to Bond's tired formula of guns, girls and gadgets as he brandishes a new action hero.	0
a predictable and stereotypically small B-movie.	0
If I were spies funny (enough) or exciting (enough), it would be quite easy to forgive the financial blackmail they are trying to reap from the public.	0
Frustratingly, dridi tells us nothing about el gallo, except what comes from his music.	0
places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult-to-swallow setting and then disappointingly puts the story in the realm of an incredible thriller.	0
Stephanie Earnhart's documentary is a decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition in the guise of unsentimental, straight-forward writing, when in reality it is an exercise in gross romanticisation of delusional personality.	0
is a very average science fiction film.	0
Unfinished by its overly complicated and derivative script, glacial direction and stereotypical characters.	0
How anyone over the age of two can digest the delicate message these sermons spread is beyond comprehension.	0
The kind of film that gives tasteless a bad rap.	0
The cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the film itself, which contains little laughter and little drama.	0
The plot is off-the-cuff, the performances on TV and the message of consolation through deception a little creepy.	0
Ordinary melodrama burdened with religious symbols, but wafer-thin on dramatic substance	0
A whimsical, if predictable, time-travel fable, clouded by a wanton determination.	0
Those who have managed to avoid the deconstructivist theory of the French philosopher jacques derrida in college can now take an 85-minute brush course with the documentary derrida Or you can have some fun tonight.	0
Jolie's appearance disappears somewhere between her hair and her lips.	0
As with too many studio opics, the plot mechanics get in the way of the adventure.	0
static, repetitive, muddy and blurry, hey! The title of the ugliest film of the year seems to be fixed.	0
For all the post-colonial consciousness of the present that Kapur tries to convey to the four feathers, the strangest thing about the film is how it ultimately confirms the same damned, moldy values that were always at the heart of the material.	0
un thriller manqué qui tombe sur les nerfs presque dès la première image.	0
When it comes to entertainment, children earn more than Pokemon Go.	0
What the four feathers lack is real momentum or feeling, or even a character worth noting.	0
While Good-natured people (who are stars and co-writers) seem to be having a wonderful time, he may be alone.	0
Yes, 4ever is harmless in the extreme and will keep your children silent for almost 80 minutes, but why not just treat the little yard monkeys to the real deal and take them away?	0
The grotesque and boring son is peppered with unintentional laughter, which unfortunately happens too rarely to make the film even a guilty pleasure.	0
Calling this film brainless would be a compliment: it's more like entertainment for trolls.	0
None of these characters resembles anyone you've ever met in real life, unless you know irritatingly headstrong people who speak in plain sentences that can only be penned by a screenwriter.	0
It's just a big mess of a film full of images and events, but no suspense or surprise.	0
As elegant as it is often designed, Anderson's film is essentially a one-trick pony that, hampered by an undeveloped script, ultimately lags.	0

has virtually no script at all.	0
will satisfy only those who do not distinguish between the good, the bad and the ugly.	0
This kind of dark comedy requires a delicate, surgical touch. But director Danny DeVito and screenwriter Adam Resnick (remember Cabin Boy?) only one pound away.	0
But sometimes Dogtown and Z-boys lapse into an insider language and mentality that the uninitiated find hard to follow or care about.	0
The film quickly lapses into a soothing formula of fraternal conflict and reconciliation.	0
Screenwriters Scott Abt and Michael Petroni have turned the complex rice akasha into a comic monster.	0
The writers, director Wally Wolodarsky and all the actors should form their own coeducational community: kappa rho alpha phi	0
Incredible and ridiculous.	0
The new faces are interesting, but the old story isn't, especially when it seems more improvised than scripted.	0
Most of the approaches are incoherent.	0
Liman, driven by swing and go, delivers something of a Klunkker in his big-budget action film debut as he delivers a long low-heat chase interrupted by a mediocre chase.	0
Surprisingly lazy for a film in which the main character travels back and forth between eras.	0
The problem is not that the film hits so close to home, but that it hits so close to home while engaging in such silly things as this snake-birth business and Schwarzenegger's inevitable fireball shot.	0

A prison comedy that never really breaks out of its cozy little cell.	0
Never again something deeply creepy, a new arrow in the quiver of Shepherd's ineptitude.	0

A painfully leaden film destined for cable television slots before dawn.	0
He is blessed with immense physical ability but he is simply not an actor. And the truth is, cruel as it may sound, he makes Arnold Schwarzenegger look like a donor.	0
the cartoon that is not really good enough to be on afternoon TV is now a movie that is not really good enough to be in the cinema.	0
Shocking only because it reveals the filmmaker's abyss of self-absorption	0
This talk of faith, hope and charity does little to offend, but if sugary seriousness were a crime, the film's producers would be trapped for life.	0
The whole thing ends well, but the funny moments never click.	0
If this is the Danish idea of a good time, would-be tourists might want to consider another destination - perhaps a fun country embroiled in a bloody civil war.	0
Formula 51 is so banal that even Yu's energetic action styling doesn't break the stun.	0
Only a few minutes pass before the father of all slashes arrives, still wearing his boiler suit and white mask, looking astonishingly clean for a man who has been mass-murdering since 1978 but has never been seen washing clothes.	0
When the painted backdrops in a film are more alive than its characters, you know you're in trouble.	0
[two] rather boring - contrasting and interlocking stories about wretched Scandinavian settlers in 18th-century Canada and yuppie sailors in the here and now.	0
The film really isn't as bad as it sounds.	0
The central story lacks punch.	0
Although Ganesh is a medium-sized success, there is nothing so impressive, fascinating, or metaphorically significant about his career as two hours of our attention.	0
This is perhaps the stupidest, sketchiest film ever made about the coming-of-age of an aspiring writer.	0
succumbs to the same kind of maudlin, sentimental mysticism that touches on films made by an angelic school of non-divine, spiritually uplifting.	0
a harmless and slightly amusing family comedy.	0
What was subtle and mysterious in the novel is now broad and ridiculous.	0
Children often seem to read the lines and are unable to convey any emotions.	0
"""Men in Black II"" has all the hallmarks of a sequel. The story is less vivid, the jokes are a bit lukewarm, but will anyone really care?"	0
Robin Louis Stewart's Treasure Island classics fill the void with sci-fi video game graphics and Disney-inspired teenage angst.	0
This 72-minute film has some thrilling scenes, but it's a bit slow.	0
Although supertroops are above academy standards, their quintet of writers might still need some schooling.	0
A mix of speed and idiocy, this ruinous remake lacks the power - and brains - of the 1970s original.	0
The low-budget Full Frontal was one of the darkest, deliberately obscure and revelatory images of the year, and solaris is its big-budget brother.	0
The plot is very clever, but Boyd burdens it with too many characters and events, all intertwined and far too complicated to follow.	0
The film seems all but destined to appear in the background of a scene in a future Quentin Tarantino picture on a television screen.	0
A free-for-all game of half-baked thoughts, clumsily applied visual tricks and self-obsessed actors.	0

I watched the brainless madness that such a thing could not happen with growing disbelief.	0
This limping, gender-fluid footballer, working as a director and screenwriter for the first time, steals the show from the 1982 Tootsie and forgets to laugh.	0
kwan makes the mix-and-match metaphors fascinating and lulls us into rigidity with his cultivated allergy to action.	0
Although it is obviously an extremely personal work, it remains inextricably entangled in an emotionally inaccessible junk.	0
Every film that is so boring should have a cinema official who gives you a cup of coffee every few minutes. Like a marathon runner trying to finish a race, you need a constant flow of fluid just to get through.	0
I loved watching that movie. I just didn't care about the story.	0
has all the sharpness of a brand card and all the comedy of a stand-up act	0
it does not do any particular shame to the original, but it does not exude charm or personality.	0
Fear-dotcom is so widespread and detached that it can never build any tension.	0
A beautiful, sleepless show, beautifully mummified and thoroughly unsurprising.	0
A semi-autobiographical film so sloppily written and cast that you can't believe anyone is more central to creating bugs than the caterer.	0
It feels like a collaborative theatre production of a great play: even at its best, it will never match the original.	0
The film apparently takes place in a fantasy world where people recite poetry in hotel corridors instead of talking to each other.	0
The surprise element is perhaps the only thing femme fatale has to offer.	0
It's the kind of film you can't really recommend because it's just a distraction and doesn't offer much scope, but you can't bring yourself to reject it.	0
Maybe it's asking too much, but if a film is to really inspire me, I want a bit more.	0
A graceful, mindless pairing attempt, which connects a lot with the spy thriller wwii	0
The plot and characters are nowhere near gripping enough.	0
The film is based on a david leavitt story and shares the usual mix of observational wisdom, superficial coincidence and slightly damaging preciousness.	0
Like any gull movie, just louder and without that silly ponytail.	0
To enjoy the sharp dialogue and delightful performance from Jolie and Burns, you have to gloss over the meaningless ending.	0
National Lampoon's van could be the worst thing to come out of the national Lampoon since unification	0
It's a great theme for a film, but Hollywood has squandered the opportunity, using it as a prop for warmed-up melodrama and the kind of choreographed chaos on which director john woo built his career.	0
Leave this one off your list.	0
Overall, the film falls far short of Jelinek's novel's brilliance. It is content to be gloomy.	0
the errors remain intact, but the fictional footage is unconvincing and is criminally badly acted.	0
It's not the thirsty, consuming passion that drives this film. No, it is the repetition of this behaviour, and therefore the children of the century are more mindless love than mad, crunchy and boring than anything.	0
Just because it really happened to you doesn't mean it's interesting to anyone.	0
Just like the deli sandwich: lots of ham, lots of cheese, with a sickly sweet shell to hide its excesses until just after (or during) the second half.	0
Every now and then comes a film that confirms the worst fears of civilization as we know it. The new one is one of them.	0
"This is not a ""Friday"" to wait for."	0
Anything worth talking about is already on TV.	0
If this film belonged to a sorority, it would be called Beta Alpha Delta.	0
Not a cheap slasher film, as the material would suggest, but a bit like a nature film showing a patient predator and his foolish prey.	0
Uncomfortable confusion of styles and genres	0
Herzog is obviously looking for a morality to his fable, but the idea that a strong, unified presence among German and Eastern European Jews might have changed 20th-century history is undermined by his underachievement.	0
All in all, there is only one thing we need to work for: expulsion for all.	0
beyond a handful of slightly amusing lines.   There's just not much to laugh about.	0
Secret ballot is too reflective to be really funny.	0
The center of the film will not hold.	0
Myers never know when to let a gag die, so we are exposed to one stunningly long riff after another.	0
Too lazy to use its semi-humorous premise.	0
a great ending doesn't make up for a weak movie, and Crazy as hell doesn't even have a great ending.	0
Dialogue-heavy and too cerebral for his own good - or at least too cerebral for his fast-paced subject.	0
The over-reliance on genre conventions, character types, and formulaic conflict resolution crushes any goodwill it might otherwise develop.	0
as an actor the stone is aptly named.	0
a mostly tired retread of some other rabble stories.	0
"I wish I could say ""thank God it's Friday,"" but the truth is I was glad when it was over."	0
None of this fits.	0
"As she abruptly crosses between the five friends, she fails to lend enough dramatic resonance to the characters ""individual stories to be taken care of."	0
Somehow, we are supposed to buy that this distraught mother avoids her children, travels to one of the most dangerous parts of the world, never gets tired and never gets tired.  Jane.	0
The cast is so weak that none of the characters is that big.   and the surroundings remain unclear.	0
Consider the chunk on the title's leg that suggests someone is working overtime to develop an irritatingly unimaginative retread.	0
The film quickly drags on, becoming boring and predictable. I tried to read the time on my watch.	0
The film makes a tragic mistake by going on too long, trying to mirror every other event in Chinese history: war, revolution, communism etc.	0
In his first film, Johnson has set himself a task he is nowhere near equal to	0
"Ultimately, the project seems clinical, detached, uninvolved, which may lead viewers to ask, ""Why?"""	0
The two main characters are almost good enough to camouflage the dark plot, but so much naturalistic small talk, delivered in almost muted conversations, ultimately has a drowning effect.	0
The film meant well with its fairy tale about freedom, but could not reach the heart because it was too bossy.	0
The film is as fast as possible, to the point where it almost halts the flow of blood to the brain; it has a dull feel.	0
Once the audience has figured out what is being said, the filmmaker's relative passivity will make it difficult for them to really care.	0
There is nothing provocative about this film except the way it studiously avoids making you think.	0
It seems to be just a long, tangled trick to get men - no less.	0
The premise for this Kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant like a six-pack and a jug of margarita in it, but the film must be written.   in the crush of a malicious hangover.	0
Even by silly action movie standards, ballistic: Sever is a silly action movie.	0
The cinematic equivalent of a toy box, the contents of which are spread over 80 minutes.	0
Just bloody chaos.	0
Creepy but ultimately unsatisfactory thriller.	0
martin scorsese cria um espetáculo visual que não possui alma - to films esteticamente belo, mas emocionalmente frio	0
They would do better to invest in the worthy Emi recording that serves as the soundtrack, or in the home video of the 1992 Malfitano Domingo production.	0
has something to say.   But it is a statement and a subject that merits much greater consideration and insight than a melodramatic and entirely predictable thriller.	0
"Bears are bad. Not ""terrible filmmaking"" bad, but rather: ""I once had a nightmare like this, and now it's coming true."""	0
As is so often the case with projects such as lofty and lofty ambitions, the film is less poetic than simply pretentious.	0
George, please hire a real director and good writers for the next part.	0
For a film about two mismatched buddies, Crystal and De Niro share little screen time and even less chemistry	0
As skillful as Nelson was in providing variety within the limits of its structure and staging, the question remains whether this really should have been presented as a theatrical implementation.	0
Extreme oops - oops, oops, no matter how you spell it, it's still a mistake.	0
What could and should have been snappy and droll is instead a lukewarm waste of time and talent.	0
The film is likely to prove the most repellent of 2002.	0
Too boring to enjoy.	0

The effects of the Armenian genocide are now diluted by too much stage business.	0
[u] relentlessly stupid.	0
Visiting the website can be as fun (and scary) as watching the film.	0
Macdowell is a placeholder for grief without gravitas, and this sloppy drama is an empty vessel. Leave these flowers unpicked - they are dead on the vine.	0
Admirable, certainly, but not particularly funny to watch. only for cocaine lovers.	0
a jumble of a film - visually unattractive, unbearably loud and completely silly.   His hilarity is entirely unintentional.	0
De Niro could enjoy the same free ride from critics that Clint Eastwood did in the lazy Blood. But like Bruce Springsteen's forgotten Asbury Park, the new jersey, this sad dead end of a film is a ruined city.	0
No, it's not nearly as good as any other influence.	0
A reasonably efficient mechanism, but one that offers few surprises and sees its stars slumbering in areas they should have avoided.	0
The rest of the plot is inexplicable without blowing away any tension, although it is more comic than tension that de palma creates.	0
Human nature talks the talk, but it fails to walk the silly walk that distinguishes the quirky from the surreal.	0
The seaside town is the cinematic equivalent of defensive driving: it is careful, conscientious and makes no big mistakes. But what saves lives on the highway is not necessarily convincing.	0
The Marquis de sade could not have been as boring as the film portrays him.	0
What could have been a pretty little story about faith in oneself is swamped by clumsy melodrama.	0
The cast is equally excellent.   But the film itself is only slightly charming.	0
drives the same bittersweet, conciliatory tone that three seasons have achieved, but lost in rhetorical excess and overt sentimentality.	0
A bigger downer than your end-of-year bill.	0
The whole thing plays with the sleepy heaviness of a synchronized swimmer in a woolly wet suit.	0
Pretty successful in feigning some pretty cool stunts, but a complete failure to create some pretty cool characters and forget about any attempt at a conspiracy!	0
It will probably be interesting to ram these fans, but to others it may seem like a parody of the gentle, peace-loving side of 1960s counterculture.	0
Take away all the clichés and copy scenes from every drug film we've seen and all you have left are John Leguizamo's cool jacket.	0
It is so full of wrong decisions that you can only shake your head in disbelief - and worry what the classic Oliver-Parker will do next time.	0

Despite its blue-chip cast and provocative title, writer-director Peter Mattei's first feature is a mix of dark romantic motifs fried in artificial sauce.	0
Fans of the TV series will be disappointed, and everyone else will be easily bored.	0

Hardly anyone gets beyond comic status.	0
It's disappointing when filmmakers throw a few great actors and cameos at a muddled script.	0

The Queen's men are terrified of falling into a farce, but are only half-hearted in their spying.	0
Painfully upholstered.	0

[Morgan], Judd and Franklin cannot save the script, which is based on a novel by Josh Finder, from any opportunism.	0

Fittingly entertaining, but also mechanical and joyless	0
Safe conduct, however ambitious and well-intentioned, does not hit the mark.	0
My reaction to the film is best described as lukewarm. Perhaps I found the process a little too conventional.	0

It is too long, too repetitive and takes far too many years to decide to be a total winner.	0
A fuzzy warning.	0
"A film that tries to merge the two ""forests,"" but ends up creating a daring masala chaos."	0
Mr Judge! Wedge and Lord Saldanha understands the mix of puns and slapstick well. But her film falters in its adherence to the Disney philosophy of sharpness, a greeting the film would hopefully avoid.	0

Unfortunately, as a writer, Mr. Montias is not nearly as good for his team as he is as a director or actor.	0
on the right path to something scary and effective.   It will take more than a man in a bullfighting costume to get there.	0
The only thing that might make them less interesting than they already are is that they are fully involved in a quirky, jovial team.	0
One of those films where you don't feel cheated, but are goaded, which in the end is even more annoying.	0
This film has a shiny cloak of action-movie excess and remains heartless at its core.	0
Murder by Numbers is like a couple of mediocre TV movies clumsily stuck together.	0
The film is surprisingly well directed by Brettner, who keeps things going - at least until the problematic third act.	0

"Like the Romans, all the Banger sisters ""paths inevitably lead to a joke about Hawn's breasts, which constantly threaten to eclipse the woman wearing them."	0
Perhaps we will get the full internal influence of a ruthless army on the warpath, but no sense of the diabolical complexity of the Balkan conflict.	0
You'd better stay home and watch the X files.	0
It's messy, smug and remarkably ugly to watch.   like a series of apparently terrible student films, assembled into a full-length horror.	0
and shares the weaknesses of too many current action fantasy extravaganzas, in which special effects overwhelm compelling stories and visual clarity during the large action sequences.	0
This is the kind of movie that frat boys and college kids enjoy best as they suck on the bong and dump one alcoholic drink after another.	0
The Friday after next Friday has the same problem as the next Friday - it's called Where is Chris tucker when you need him?	0
This movie is full of rabbits. Exuberant. But like most rabbits, it seems to lack substance.	0
I weep for the future when a good chunk of the respected critical community in this country thinks Blue Crush is a smart film about young women.	0
I always wish I'd seen a documentary about the Navajos of war and their accomplishments instead of that flimsy Hollywood hoo-ha.	0
No amount of fantastic sets, extras, costumes and spectacular locations can hide the emptiness at the heart of the story.	0
A film that is far more cynical and lazy than anything a fictional merchant of Charlie's blood could object to.	0
Could the country really be as bad as its supporters? In a word - yes.	0
If high crimes were more common, it would have a universal product code instead of a title.	0
reggio succumbs to the temptation to rely on the very digital technology he passionately despises, creating a meandering, inarticulate and ultimately disappointing film	0
The film makes absolutely no sense. The underlying mythology is a hotchpotch of contradictions that raises the question: Since when does stupid entertainment have to be so stupid?	0
The problem with this film is that it is forced to turn its characters into idiots to advance the plot. If anyone had done anything remotely intelligent here, we could all have stopped watching.	0
Despite the authenticity of the insignia, the film's plot is overblown, its dialogue hackneyed and its style anachronistic	0
Murder and mayhem of this kind quickly become monotonous.	0
the journey to redemption feels more like a cinematic experiment than a full-blown film.	0
That Zhang would make such a tiresomely cute film - with a blind orphan at the center, no less - shows where his ambitions went.	0
The interviews tend to get the boys off the hook.	0
The streets shot by cinematographer Michael Ballhaus may be as authentic as they are mean, but it's almost impossible to care what happens on them.	0
This is a good film in small steps, but if it doesn't work, it's at important times.	0
Parker probably thinks he's shaking up a classic, like Kenneth Branagh and Baz Luhrmann, but this half-hearted muddling makes us miss Wilde's contemporary play.	0
Flotsam in the sea of filmmaking, not big enough to worry about causing significant damage, and not smelly enough to despise.	0
a television series that grew beyond its natural length.	0
Sometimes entangled, he lapses into the absurd rather casually.	0
All these developments and challenges that Santa Claus faces weigh so heavily on the plot that they rob the entire film of its energy and unnecessarily burden its credibility.	0
Anaemic, pretentious.	0
There is a strange resonance here between the actor and the role, which is not exactly flattering.	0
The relentless sadism is so graphically excessive that the director exposes his own obsession	0

Even though Britney Spears is really sweet, her movie is really bad.	0
The big fat liar is just senseless stupidity trying to cater to childish sensibilities.	0

The necessary exposure prevents the image from rising above your general sandals adventure.	0
A simple, satirical documentary that distorts facts, makes superficial arguments and refers to the cinematic equivalent of tabloid journalism	0

An exaggerated clown full of bad jokes, howling clichés and action sequences.	0
Without a strong script and energetic action, dogma films can have the same sleep-promoting effects as watching the videos at home.	0
a mild, hesitant thumbs down.	0

Schindler's List is long.	0
a cinematic sleeping pill of impressive effect.	0
It's a horribly derivative story.	0
With its incredible naivety and random flashbacks, the film hardly makes sense.	0
It's a serious debut full of hearty performances, but ultimately disappointed by an all-too-predictable story.	0
About as innovative as pet rock: the film.	0
With generic sets and B-grade special effects, Jason is about as convincing on the sci-fi front as the late Cleopatra is on TV.	0
is not sweet enough to revive its predictable history and will bitterly disappoint even hip-hop fans.	0
In the end, it feels like many other quirky films that try to score hipness points with young adults.	0
The film, often described as an antidote to American sex comedies, actually has a lot in common with them, missing every opportunity for a breakthrough.	0
The pace is glacial, the script stiff as a board, and it's only in the final scenes of the film that things get heated.	0
The premise is overshadowed by the clerical overreach, as this is just another kung fu science fiction film with silly action sequences.	0

"The pumpkin struts around on the lapel of his shopkeeper with ""courage,"" while a yellow stripe a mile wide graces his back."	0
An unequal film that deals with too many problems to be taken seriously.	0
Sheridan.   smooths out sources of conflict that could have given the film some more depth.	0
An atonal oestrogen opera that demonises feminism and gives the most sympathetic man in the play a nice vomit at his wedding.	0
Half of it consists of snappy rattling and pseudo-sophisticated cultural observations, while the rest consists.   would be more at home with a TV show during the day.	0
Writer-director John Mackay kindles a charming chemistry between Kate and Jed, but when he slips into a drenched melodrama punctuated by violins, it's disastrous and Kate's jealous girlfriends become downright loathsome.	0
[Newton] wanders through Charlie, completely unaware that she needs to show some presence and star quality.	0
Unfortunately, the picture did not capture me. I found it slow, boring and bordering on melodramatic.	0
A lousy film that is not only invisible, but also inaudible.	0
The best way to hope for a chance to enjoy this film is to lower expectations. then lower it a bit further.	0

Watching the film is like reading a contemporary portrait of grief, which keeps shifting the focus to the journalist who wrote it.	0
There were enough similarities to Gymkata and Howie Long's firestorm that my fingernails instinctively crawled towards my suffering eyeballs.	0
succeeds in bringing the long-dreaded conclusion of the Police Academy series to a worrying world.	0
Christians sensitive to a reductionist view of their Lord as a lustful Dr. Feel-good or almighty negligence people will feel infinitely more offended than secularists who might even praise God for delivering such an instant camp classic.	0
If this dud had been made in the 1970s, it would have been called Hill Antler and played in drive-ins for three weeks.	0
A desperate search for laughs, with a hit rate that doesn't exactly please the audience.	0

"""a whole film about researchers quietly reading dusty old letters."""	0
pryor lite, with half the demons, half the daring, much less talent, much less laughter.	0
What is at stake in this film is nothing more than an obsolete, if irritating, notion of class.	0
The stories here suffer from the chosen format.	0
While the mystery of the nature of the shipwreck remains intriguing enough to sustain a mild interest, the picture refuses to offer much accompanying food in the form of characterization, humor, or plain popcorn.	0
How extreme are these tops? I regret to report that these surgeries are just not extreme enough	0
The actors are forced to deal with fuzzy motivations that never come into focus.	0
john leguizamo may be a dramatic actor - just not in this movie.	0
The sequel has become utterly and irrevocably bizarre to the point of complete nonsense.	0
The kind of points that Egoist wanted to make are scarce, and it does not exist as the kind of monument he wanted to erect to the victims whose voices never reached the ears of the world.	0
Build a few robots, drag them into the theater for the late-night show, and set up your own Mystery Science Theater 3000, a homage to what is almost certainly the worst - and only - killer movie of the year or another.	0
Rainy days and films about family breakdown always bring me down.	0

The master of disaster - a piece of dirt disguised as comedy.	0
This is not a film, but a symptom.	0
The film has some nice ideas and some humble chuckles, but unfortunately it's not very child-friendly, Santa is buzzing more than Santa Claus and the snowman (who is never allowed to play this flute) has the charm of meltdown.	0

That's not much use.	0
A film made with as little wit, interest and professionalism as artistically possible for a muddy Hollywood caper.	0
Worryingly superficial in his handling of the material.	0

I hate this movie	0
It's hard to know what's in abundance in Scott Kalvert's woefully hackneyed 1958 film about street gangs and turf wars - stale clichés, gratuitous violence or empty machismo.	0
Gooding and Coburn are both Oscar-winning actors, a fact that seems inconceivable when you watch them awkwardly wallowing in snowmen.	0
At every opportunity to do something clever, the film goes beyond the box office, killing any sense of credibility.   All you have left is an unsurprising series of explosions and violence, while Banderas looks as if he's not laughing at how bad it is	0
Pathetic, slapstick disaster. A dud from the first picture.	0
Jaw-droppingly superficial, exhausting, with a sense of humour that is not even as daring as the glory days of John Ritter in Three company.	0
There are many scenes in Frida that work, but rarely it's about the title character.	0
Although God is great, there are interesting questions of identity and heritage at stake, but the sense that it should be another film is hard to shake.	0
The dark and bittersweet twist feels strange, as things get nasty and tragic in the final third of the film. First-time starter john mckay is never able to get it back on track	0
Remove yourself by throwing away so many herrings, so many false scaremongering, that the real ones hardly notice.	0
Godard uses his figures - if not too glorified - as art objects, mouthpieces, pictorial motifs, blanks.	0
The film generates plot points with a degree of randomness that is normally only achieved by lottery drawing.	0
A predictable, manipulative stinker. The story goes on until it's time for an absurd finale of twisted metal, fireballs and revenge.	0
Ostwood twitches, clutches his chest and breathes. It's a spectacular performance - ahem, we hope it's just acting.	0
The film suffers from two deadly diseases - a lack of vitality and a story that is formless and immobile.	0

An ambitiously naturalistic, if half-baked, drama about an abused inner-city autistic teenager.	0
As soon as she lets her depraved love stories collide, [Denis's] story becomes a hopeless, unsatisfactory mess	0

What's really sad is that two Oscar winners (and one Oscar winner) are turning up in this junk that is at best TV sitcom.	0
No doubt the star and everyone else involved had their hearts in the right place. Where their heads were, no one can say.	0
Call me a cynic, but there is something terribly lethal about any film with a life-affirming message.	0
is an extraordinarily unfunny groan, littered with one-dimensional, unlikeable characters and hackneyed, flimsy comic setups.	0

A painfully slow film full of clichés that has more holes than a wheelbarrow car.	0
like browsing through a photo album accompanied by the most sketchy captions.	0
I think it just shows that if you give an unlimited amount of false blood to a filmmaker, nothing good happens.	0
Gaghan captures the semi-lit, sometimes creepy intimacy of student halls, a subtlety that makes the silly, over-the-top coda particularly disappointing.	0
This feels less like a change in personal policy than a half-hearted mistake.	0
one of the most unpleasant things the studio ever produced.	0

"true to its animated roots:.   As stiff, ponderous and charming as a mechanical device.   ""The bears of the country"" should never have been brought out of hibernation."	0
[Evans] is a fascinating character and deserves a better vehicle than that superficial smile of a movie.	0
The screenplay's judgment and weight are far removed.	0
One wishes, however, that the film would spend much less time making credible arguments for reports from the afterlife, and much more time on the romantic urgency at the heart of the story.	0
evelyn may be based on a true and historically significant story, but the filmmakers have gone to great lengths to disguise it as the invention of an unimaginative screenwriter.	0
a derivative collection of horror and science fiction cliches.	0

For a long-time admirer of his work, it is difficult not to fall into invincibility and overlook its drawbacks.	0
Loafers directed by Charles Stone.   From a leaden script by matthew cirulnick and novel thulani davis.	0
Although Jones and Snipes are compelling, the film sinks into rhetoric and cliche.	0
The most remarkable (and frustrating) thing about the world tour, which opens today in Manhattan, is that its protagonist, after 104 minutes of intense scrutiny, is completely empty.	0
An art film with too much exploitation and too little art.	0
The pace is often far off and there are too many good-faith moans among too few laughs.	0
with lines that feel like long one-on-one conversations -- even when framed in conversation -- max is static, stilted.	0
During its seemingly eternal life span, it barely manages for a few seconds to awaken your interest, your imagination, your empathy or anything, really, to save your disgust and indifference.	0
Writer-director Burr manages the q in bizarre ways, with mixed results.	0
One senses in globetrotters and in his earlier film that he endures a painful but obscure complaint against fathers and circles them obsessively without making contact.	0
In between the icy stunts, the actors hilariously talk about how to pursue their dream and 'let the mountain tell you what to do'.	0
the obligatory separations and hook-ups do not seem to have much emotional impact on the characters.	0
Make no mistake, this is not the case. is a mess.	0
hypnotically dull, mercilessly depressed, ridiculously predictable whines to the beat of the suicidal poetry of a depressed 15 year old.	0
The concept is a hit. The trailer is a riot. The film is a dud.	0
It is a boring film about a boring man, made visible by a brilliant performance by a consummate actor who is incapable of being boring.	0
Since the level of intelligence of the characters has to be low, very low, very low for the masquerade to work, the film contains no jokes, only laborious gags.	0
It's hard to imagine another director ever making his wife look so bad in a big film.	0
Some stunning pictures - and some stunningly boring movies.	0
These characters are getting tired.	0
A hack affair, thoroughly amusing, but not as outrageous or funny as Cho might have intended or as imaginative as one might have hoped.	0
This could be the first ever cartoon that looks like it's being shown on a sports bar screen.	0
kim ki-deok seems to have in mind (emotionally at least) a young audience that demands regular shocks and bouts of barely justifiable sexual violence in order to maintain its interest.	0
a brilliant film - a cross between boys not crying, redemption and ode to billy joe - lies somewhere in the story of matthew shepard, but this film is yet to come.	0
Having read this sloppy comedy special conceived for the film, I wonder if lawmakers hate criticism so much that they refuse to evaluate their own work.	0
invented pastiche of caper clichés	0
Many shallower films these days seem too long, but this one is tremendously short.	0
Only a kiss is an imaginative film about the typical problems of average people. But it's set in a world that's very, very far removed from where most of us live.	0
The worst-conceived animated comedy since Dog Rover in 1991.	0
Like shaving ice without a coating, this mound of cinematic snow is as harmless as it is tasteless.	0
"Despite its sincere acting, ""Signs"" is just another unoriginal sequel to the Mills sci-fi film with a flimsy ending and lots of hype."	0
Another film that assumes that social groups in high school are at war, let alone aware of their existence.	0
Loud, messy and largely unfunny.	0
I can't remember the last time I saw an audience laugh so much during a movie, but there's only one problem that's supposed to be drama.	0
Properties that were once amusing are becoming irritating.	0
Well, Jason has gone to Manhattan and hell, I guess a space station in the year 2455 can be removed from the idea list for the inevitable future sequels (hey, don't shoot the messenger).	0
Donovan.   wastes its most important asset, jackie chan, and mutilates the crucial plot lines.	0
There is no psychology or real narrative logic here - just a series of carefully choreographed atrocities that become strangely impersonal and abstract	0
Bread, my candy has so many flaws that it would be easy for critics to crush it. It might even fall into the category of movies you love to hate. I admit it, I hate it.	0
frida is certainly not a disaster, but neither is it the Kahlo film that Frida fans are looking for.	0
Leaks come out of every pore.	0
The characters are so generic and the plot so bland that we don't feel much sympathy for Damon or his predicament, even if rogue killers working for the agency boss of Chri Cooper are close to the imaginative amnesia circuit.	0
Kapur burdens the story with bogus profundity.	0
As we want MacDowell's character to bring her husband back, we must wonder if her personal odyssey surpasses the carnage that has claimed so many lives.	0
The blue stream is as predictable as the tides.    The film feels like it has been sewn together from film situations and characters from other films.	0
If you like to be rewarded by a script that assumes you're not very clever, blood work is for you.	0
In a way, every day is a success, but it's hard to like a film so cold and dead.	0
The stage art of the film is intimate and therefore bolder than the otherwise calculated artifice that determines and overwhelms the film's production design.	0
A well-intentioned effort that is still too burdened by the actor's weird sensations for the serious emotional core to emerge with a degree of accessibility.	0
A family-friendly fantasy that ultimately achieves very little with its imaginative premise.	0
A defiant look at the French Revolution through the eyes of aristocrats	0
Tom Shadyac has learned a little more craft since directing Adams, but he still perseveres at every point until the slowest viewer understands.	0
Like a pompous, low-key infomercial that combines entrepreneurial zeal with the testimony of satisfied customers.	0
a fast-paced, glittering but extremely stupid piece.	0
Any reasonably creative eighth-grader could have written a more credible script, albeit with the same number of continuity errors.	0
"While the humorous aspects of ""Jason x"" were much more entertaining than I expected, everything else was at the film tanks."	0
Your preference for Jonah - a film about vegan stories may well depend on your threshold for pop manifestations of the Holy Spirit	0
Like an after-school special with costumes by Gianni Versace, Mad Love looks better than it feels.	0
While certain hints, such as the joyful music, suggest that this film should warm our hearts, Jeong-hyang Lee's film will blacken that organ with cold revenge.	0
The script, the gags, the characters are all straight on video, and that should have been this movie.	0
A thriller without thrills and a thriller without urgent questions.	0
a collage of clichés and a faint echo of references to other films	0
The film is hampered by its predictable plot and gossamer supporting characters.	0
A gay film.	0
Jonas is just like that.   The addition of a biblical message will either improve or diminish the film for you.	0
A painful demonstration of the irrecoverability of a film burdened with an amateurish script.	0
How often will indie filmmakers tell us boring, self-important stories about how awful we are to ourselves and each other?	0
There are a few laughs in this film, but Williams's anarchy becomes annoying, the satire weak.	0
As steaming as last week's pork dumplings.	0
There is incoherence.	0
The dark tempo and lack of dramatic fireworks make the green dragon seem more like medicine than entertainment.	0
The filmmakers needed more emphasis on storytelling and less on the glamorous machine that propels audiences into a future that won't mean much to them.	0
Another entirely unnecessary addition to the growing, mouldy pile of, well, extreme stunt pictures.	0
This tiresomely unfunny Showtime deserves the hook.	0
The whole thing is pretty lame, making it a prime example of Disney sequels.	0
Her solemn presumption prevents us from sharing the reverence in which she finds herself.	0
"The good and the bad [of middle-aged romance] is not handled well, and apart from the beautiful star appearances, there is little else to recommend ""never again."""	0
"If Disney's Cinderella proves that ""a dream is a wish of the heart,"" Cinderella ii proves that a nightmare is a wish fulfilled in a studio's wallet."	0
offers nonsensical and ridiculous plots, wooden performances, clumsily staged action sequences, and some of the worst dialogues of recent times.	0
Rare birds are trying to transplant a Hollywood star into the wild soil of Newfoundland - just like the shipping news before them - and the rock is once again resisting the invasion.	0
Nothing about this film works.	0
If the idea of a white man arriving on foreign shores to show wary locals the true light is repulsive to you, the sky is more likely to resemble hell.	0
A spooky yarn of demonic activity on the high seas, the less the brain is involved the better.	0
None of the events calculated surprises us.	0
Are monsters born or created?	0
Lisa Rinzler's cinematography may be beautiful, but the story of love Lisa herself practically falls into an inhalation failure and maintains consciousness just long enough to achieve a quiet claim.	0
The narrator and the other characters try to convince us that acting transfigures the ether, but it has never been seen on stage; one feels betrayed, and ether seems to remain an unchanged shred.	0
It's exactly the kind of film critics always accuse him of.	0
With the Dog Days in August, imagine this dog of a movie as the cinematic equivalent of high humidity.	0
It was less about the chills than the spawning power of fools who watched Quentin Tarantino's handful of coarse gangster movies and took refuge in their own pseudo-funny imitations.	0
The film is like sitting in a downtown café, listening to a couple of typically late-twenties grumble about nothing and desperately wishing you could switch tables.	0
This rather unfocused, all-encompassing film would be much better if it reduced its storylines and characters to a few rather than dozens.   Or if it were more subtle.   Or whether she had a sense of humour.	0
takes a clunky approach to television film to describe a chapter in the life of the celebrated Irish playwright, poet and drinker.	0
The thoroughly formulaic film embodies not only the mainstream of the center, but also glossy Hollywood in its laziness.	0
It is a pity that the theft of the crop is too busy getting in the way of itself to be anything but frustrating, boring and forgotten.	0
Almost every attempt to make sense of it is doa.	0
collapses under his own lean weight.	0
This is mild, already existing material, set in motion by a director who needed a touch of the extravagant, the outrageous.	0
If you loved the full Monty so much that you died to see the same old thing in a tired old environment, then you should be reasonably entertained.	0
technically and artistically incapable.	0
Those who are only slightly curious will, I fear, be euthanized or confused by the artful and often meaningless images.	0
Tom Shadyac's film begins spooky enough, but halfway through it takes an abrupt turn into glucose sentimentality and ridiculous inventions.	0
a long, boring procession of despair, set to cello music from a minimalist funeral.	0
I call myself a cold-hearted failure because I can't enjoy a pointless action movie, but I think a movie can be pointless without being the pinnacle of everything.	0
Death could be liberation.	0

Pinocchio, despite its $50 million budget, never quite achieves the feel of a fantastic film.	0
This is now a third-person story told by Hollywood, and much more ordinary for that.	0
The filmmakers know how to please the eye, but it's not always the best pictures that tell the best story.	0
Written, directed, and, scarcely, directed by David Kendall.	0
The characters are interesting and the relationship between Yosuke and Saeko is worth watching as it develops, but the story has not enough to fill two hours.	0

It is depressing to see how far things have fallen.	0
"The question hanging over the time machine is not, as the main character suggests, ""what if?"" But: ""How can you ask for money?"""	0
Millions of dollars spent on a project of such enormous proportions must bring in more than flashy blue-screen technology and stylish weapons.	0
"""Freaky Friday,"" it's not."	0
Perhaps a film that is not so painfully forced, false and fabricated would be a better celebration of these wrongly dismissed heroes.	0
Although no pastries are hurt, this nasty comedy pokes fun at the same simple goals as other raunch-fests - farts, breasts, the unspeakable - without much success.	0
In this film, Aussie David Caesar channels the not-quite-dead career of guy Ritchie	0
You may be lucky and there will be a power cut during the performance, so you get your money back.	0
The characterizations and dialogues lack depth or complexity, with the ironic exception of Roller.	0
This film was made by and for the people who collect the serial killer cards and are fascinated by the mere suggestion of serial killers. For all of us, sitting through the two hours is little more than punishment.	0
Narc can only remind us of brilliant crime dramas without becoming one himself.	0
Somewhere in the mess that is the globetrotter, a mediocre film tries to emerge.	0
a tiresome parable about honesty and sportiness.	0
His strengths and weaknesses are practically pitted against each other, with the unfortunate trump card being the dreary middle ground.	0
An artful yet depressing film that turns the molehill of a missing bike into a melodramatic mountain.	0
The ultimate point of the film - that everyone should be themselves - is banal, but writer-director Michel Gondry makes it ridiculous.	0
Glossy knock-off of a B-movie revenge movie.	0
expands the horizon of boredom to collapse and turns into a black hole of boredom from which no interesting concept can escape.	0
It's just boring.	0
Sad nonsense, that. But not without a cheesy fun factor.	0
One of those decades-long historical epics that strives to be intimate and socially inclusive, but fails to do justice to any of those efforts in three hours of screen time.	0
really stupid, but sometimes really funny.	0
The film oscillates between typical card sentimentality and silly, life-affirming moments straight from a mobile phone ad.	0
A half-hearted film.	0
The director's many evasions and twists result in little more than a handful of gamesmanship that promises little tension and little profit.	0
"While the transgressive trappings (especially the overt sex scenes) ensure that the film never gets boring, Rodrigues ""monster-in-itself metaphor is ultimately rather silly and exaggerated, making the ambiguous ending seem more stupid than provocative."	0
The satire is unfocused, while the story leads nowhere.	0
They threw a lot of money at an idea that should have been so much more, even if it was just for teenagers and wrestling fans.	0
It is embedded in a shabby script, piling layer upon layer of action-man clichés on wooden dialogue, and a shifting tone that falls far short of the peculiar moral amorality of the best work.	0
Reyes' directorial debut has good things to offer, but is ultimately undone by a sloppy script	0
If you are over 25 years old, have an iq over 90 and have a driving licence, you should be able to find better entertainment.	0
The darker elements of misogyny and unprovoked violence suffocate the enlightenment created by the two daughters and the sparse humor that shines through the dark film-noir veil.	0
The cleverness of the image is ironically muffled by the very people who are supposed to make it shine.	0
"""lilo & stitch"" never reaches the emotion or timelessness of Disney's great past, or even recent successes like ""Mulan"" or ""Tarzan."	0
one of those so-called films that could have been much better	0
Crossroads feels like a teen-movie full of adolescent intimations of scandal and high-tension but limp drama.	0
Genre politics, genre thrillers or its inherent humor are not used enough.	0
The interview with the assassin is structured less as a documentary than as a find, and as such the film struggles to shake its roots in real time.	0
The vision of cacoyannis is far less mature and interprets the piece as a call to pity and sympathy for anachronistic phantasms chasing the imaginary glory of their own past.	0
It has more in common with fireworks than with a film that is normally expected to have characters and plot.	0
It seems to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is completely alien.	0
Less a heartfelt appeal for the disabled than a lovely Belgian waffle	0
Listening to extremist calls for names, whether you think of Kissinger as a calculating fiend or just a slippery self-promoter, does not help.	0
He spends 90 minutes trying to figure out whether some cocky, pseudo-intellectual child has deliberately left college or been killed. The only problem is that in the end, no one in the audience or in the film seems to really care.	0
This is not a minimalist Beauty and the Beast, but in this case the beast should definitely get top billing. Robert john burke as the monster horns in and steals the show.	0
The rest of the cast look like stick figures reading lines from a teleprompter, thanks to stoic, soap-opera dialogue.	0
[T] he film is never sure whether it will make a clear point, even if it wants to rely on an ambiguous presentation.	0
Although it may not add up to the sum of its parts, Holofcenter's film offers just enough insight to save it from simplicity, and the cast is engaged enough to keep you from sitting in an armchair too often.	0
A twisted Taiwanese soap about three people and their troubled relationship	0
No one seems to have cared about any aspect of the film, from the cheesy script to the grey quality of the lighting to its haphazard last-minute release.	0
"A thoroughly horrible film - stupid, narrative chaotic, visually sloppy.   a strange amalgam of ""the thing"" and a geriatric ""scream"""	0
Another example of Sandler losing touch.	0
Nothing really sticks, except the lingering creepiness that one feels when being dragged through a sad, filthy universe of weapons, drugs, greed and destroyed dreams.	0
"What unfolds in the 110 minutes of ""Panic Room"" is a battle of the mind between a not very clever mother and daughter and an even less capable criminal trio."	0
The inventions of the plot are uncomfortably loaded.	0
Blame the worst sin that can be ascribed to a film like this: it's not scary in the least.	0
He bounces around with his wrists flaccid, wears tight abdominal walls and a hip hug, twirls his hair on his finger and assumes that's enough to make you laugh.	0
Its simplicity puts an exclamation mark on the fact that this is not to be taken seriously, but also destroys any chance that the film will outgrow similar fare.	0
After the final whistle, one is convinced this mean-spirited machine was a decent TV presence who simply had no magic on the big screen.	0
To say that this steam-fuelled vehicle is decidedly boring and uneventful is as obvious as telling a skunk it has a strong body odour.	0
A film of empty, fetishistic violence in which murder is casual and funny.	0
Imagine being a werewolf by avoiding eye contact and walking away slowly. It's fun, but it's a real howl.	0
a few good actors, but ultimately a film for no reason.	0
It is difficult to feel anything other than slight disturbances or distanced joy in the acting while watching this film.	0
"a water-saturated version of the ""fatal attraction"" for the teen bopper set   A sorry, soggy cauldron squandering the talents of its attractive young executives."	0
It tells its story flat and leaves the impression that it should have made more of it than it did.	0
Dear Jesus, did the scriptwriters just cut out all the bad action movies in history?	0
It's not the worst comedy of the year, but it certainly won't win an award.	0
This is largely a useless film, even with a great director at the helm.	0
A loud, mindless mess, with none of the charm or intrigue of the TV show.	0
Even under their own ludicrous conditions, the sum of all fears creates little narrative momentum and invites unflattering comparisons with other parts of the Ryan series.	0
Although it inspires some creative thinking (off the field), the film is - to its own detriment - much more of a cinematic collage than a polemic.	0
As predictable as the outcome of a game of globetrotting generals, juwanna mann is even more grotesque than you'd expect from the genre of the guy in the dress, and a personal low point for all involved.	0
is submerged in the usual cafeteria goulash of fart, masturbation and racist Japanese jokes	0
Where Tom Green stages his gags as attacks on America's knee-jerk moral hypocrisy, Jackass lacks ambition for social change.	0
Rather a fascinating curiosity than a gripping thriller.	0
april 2002 part of the american war of independence, complete with lots of cgi and bushels of violence but not a drop of human blood.	0
contains all the substance of a Twinkie -- easy to swallow but hardly nutritious.	0
Return to neverland manages to draw the line between another classic for the company and another ordinary Disney sequel for the home video market.	0
Rarely does a film come across as gracefully and undeservedly as this.	0
It's a thin performance that repeatedly stretches out, drowns in self-consciously shrill camera effects, booming house music and flat, flat dialogue.	0
On some level, Blue Crush keeps what it promises, just not good enough to recommend it.	0
the colourful masseur wastes his time on mood rather than riding on the inherent absurdity of Ganesh's ascent up the social ladder.	0
An incredibly ponderous, manipulative dud who feels all too familiar.	0
The New York Times dodges the issue by opting for this sort of evaluation, so that the more graphic violence is largely off-screen and sexuality remains silent.	0
"The trap presents a scary and compelling ""what if?"" scenario that gives most parents pause for thought.    Then something terrible happens."	0
Madonna's gone over so many times now that there seems to be nothing left to work with, like Michael Jackson's nose	0
Since I have never seen the first two films in the series, I cannot compare Friday to Friday, but nothing would change the fact that we have a load of clams here that stay a good three days in the scorching sun.	0
of the story lacks real emotional impact, and the plot is both constructed and cliché.	0
a depraved, incoherent, instantly available piece of hacking.	0
It's a bad action movie because there's no interest and the spectacle is grotesque and boring.	0
[Soderbergh] tends to put most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trusting the intelligence of the audience, and he creates a general sense of rudeness.	0
Handsome and sincere, but a little clumsy in his combination of entertainment and evangelical boosterism.	0
So aggressively cheerful that Pollyana would reach for a barrel.	0
scooby-doo doesn't know if it's a retro retooling exercise for older fans or a silly, Nickelodeon-like children's movie.	0
He lacks the visual verve, comic touch and perhaps the budget for summer title fights.	0
extremely uneven and inconsistent.   Margarita Happy Hour is a bit like the El Cheapo margaritas it serves.	0
very stupid and annoying.	0
The sum of all fears pretends to be a serious investigation into nuclear terrorism, but in reality it is nothing more than warmed-up Cold War paranoia.	0
A listless and despondent affair.	0
represents the abyss into which the film, which behaves badly, fell.	0
How incompetent is the service to Sara? It makes even Elizabeth Hurley seem graceful and ugly.	0
Full of literally agonising jokes. Someone is clocked about every five minutes.	0
"wins my vote for the film award ""Enemy of Cinema."""	0
Every Chekhov is better than no Chekhov, but it would be a shame if this were your introduction to one of the greatest plays of the last 100 years.	0
Helmer Hudlin tries to make a hip comedy, but his reliance on slapstick prevents the possibility of creating a darker tome.	0
Lazy, miserable and complacent. This is one of the biggest disappointments of the year.	0
Formula 51 has dulled your senses faster and deeper than any other recreational drug on the market.	0
Every visual wit is milked, every shot obvious and long-winded, every punchline predictable. There is no energy.	0
The writer and director Attal apparently thought he just had to sit around in their drawers with his movie star wife to justify a film.	0
After the setup, the air escapes from the film and flattens about an hour before the end.	0
This is a poster film, a mediocre homage to films like this!	0
With three hours and very little story or character development, there is plenty of room for editing, and a much shorter cut would surely have resulted in a smoother, more focused narrative without sacrificing any cultural intrigue.	0
A bit too derivative to stand on its own as the psychological thriller it purports to be.	0
A crude, youthful variation on a theme explored by playwright Craig Lucas in his prelude to a kiss, with infinitely more grace and eloquence.	0
The film's darker moments are smoothed out by the overwhelming need for tender, inspiring news, especially in the final sad moments.	0
If you recognize Zeus (the dog from the Snatch), you will wish you could see this movie at home and not in the cinema.	0
Deeply pathetic	0
"It's the kind of film you only have to watch for about thirty seconds before you say, ""Oh yeah, here we have a bad, bad, bad movie."""	0
Shanghai ghetto should be praised for finding a new angle on a tireless story, but perhaps you should think twice before booking the trip.	0
Pieces like a checklist listing everything Cleaner and his cast throw away.	0
There is too much forced drama in this wildly unequal film about a young man's struggle with his inevitable past and uncertain future in a very malleable but largely unfulfilled present.	0
It is laughable and obsessively observable in its dedicated stupidity.	0
all the sensuality, all the eroticism of a good vampire fairy tale, forgive the pun, sucked up and replaced by divine goodness.	0
A mixture of Blow and Boyz n the hood, this film aspires to be more, but it doesn't quite make it. Good performances prevent it from becoming a total repetition.	0
The script is hugely over-written, with endless dialogue - most of it directed at children.	0
Troll the cult section of your local video store for the real deal.	0
Sometimes the film looks really nice. Your nightmares, on the other hand, will be anything but. not even felinni knew what to think of this Italian freakshow.	0
elmo advertises its drug as 51 times stronger than coke. If you're looking for a story about British bad behaviour, watch how they behave. 51 times better than this.	0
It is hard to imagine anyone who has reached puberty actually finding the characters in Slackers or their antics amusing or even funny.	0
"Despite its promising cast of characters, the big problem remains a loosely connected series of vignettes that only prove that ""crazy"" doesn't necessarily mean ""funny."	0
Shrill and soporific at the same time, and because everything is repeated five or six times, it can seem tediously simple.	0
does not go far enough in its humor or ideas to be particularly memorable or even funny.	0
Neither overtly nor really edgy - just crassly extravagant and comedic.	0
Virtually everyone involved here seems to be rotating. There are a few modest laughs, but certainly no thrills.	0
fails so fundamentally on any conventional level that it reaches some kind of stupid size.	0
There is a lingering theatrical mood and a blurry quality to the way the story is told that undermines the devastating narrative effect of the total loss embodied in the film's simple title.	0
While Howard's appreciation of Brown and his writing is clearly well-meaning and sincere, the film would be impossible to sustain without the supporting cast.	0
a grotesque, prudish journeyman.	0
Go, girls, down the reality drain.	0
With some of the worst-staged and most illuminated action in memory, Hoax is as close as an imitation movie.	0
"can be classified as one of these ""alternative reality"" films.   Except that it would have worked so much better if it had dealt with just one reality."	0
predictable and tempting, though brown sugar is so earnest in its nostalgia for the days before nihilism that it evokes more spirit and bite than the average formula-romantic square.	0
unlikeable, uninteresting, unfunny and totally inept.	0
The film is so busy referring to other films and trying to be other films that it doesn't have its own heart, mind or humour.	0
An imponderably stilted and self-consciously artistic film.	0
Kinky, melodramatic paranormal romances are an all-time low for Kevin Costner.	0
Too clumsy at crucial moments.   to cause a sensation.	0
Just a couple of good actors twirling around in a hoodie that's neither original nor terribly funny.	0
"""Matrix"" -like massacres are everywhere.   But the film has a harder time balancing its violence with Kafka-inspired philosophy."	0
At least it's a pretty impressive debut from director Charles Stone.	0
Everything develops predictably, and the adventures that take place along the way seem to repeat themselves, designed to fill time without really creating tension.	0
wanker-goths are loose! Run for your life!	0
Why would anyone want to play the great Jackie Chan in a film full of stunt doubles and special effects?	0
A raven-black, emaciated flirt.	0
In the film, an unambitious writing appears, using a plot that could come from an animated screenplay.	0
is a good argument, but not a reason for us to go beyond basic principles of human decency.	0
We have poignant images that defy farce, thoughtful dialogue pushed aside by one-liners, and a visual style that includes rotoscope animations for no apparent reason, except perhaps that it looks neat.	0
Unbearably lame.	0
According to the script, Grant and Ox are made for each other. But you would never guess that from the performances.	0
The animation merely serves up a predictable, maudlin story that weighs heavily on Bambi and the Lion King, but lacks the emotional resonance of any of these films.	0
Araat feels like a book	0
steve oedekerk is unfortunately not a woody all.	0
Much like the imaginary sport he projects on the screen - loud, violent and mindless.	0
An amalgam of fleeting, fleeting and total recall, but without much energy or tension.	0
The plot is amateurish, the cinematography gruesome, the direction clumsy, the writing flimsy and the violence lurid and laughably unconvincing.	0
shows that jackie chan is getting older, and that's something I'd rather deny	0
with miscast cast, banal dialogues and an absurdly exaggerated climax, the gentle killing belongs firmly in the camp of the so-called bad-is-good.	0
Unfortunately, the black-and-white archive footage of her nude shows pretty mediocre shit.	0
The slapstick is edited, the larger parts flat.	0
This is the kind of film where people who have never chosen a castle can easily become experts after a few attempts.	0
The problem with the mess in Formula 51 is not that it is offensive but that it is boring.	0
Much of the digitally altered footage seems jagged, as if it were filmed directly from a television screen, while the extensive use of footage quickly becomes an annoying cliche.	0
The film never rises above a conventional, two-dimensional story	0
Mark Wahlberg.   He may look classy in a 1960s Pokepie hat, but as a character he's dry, dry, dry.	0
The film, which is told scattered throughout, only occasionally does justice to the stories, faces and music of the men involved.	0
The irony is that the cast of this film is uniformly excellent; their performances could and should have been on their own.	0
"Now I can understand why people thought I was being too harsh with the ""Mottenmann prophecies."""	0
If ever a concept was handed down from the film gods on a silver tray, this is it. If ever such a reliable concept was botched in execution, it is this.	0
"With an unusual protagonist (a kilt-wearing Jackson) and theme, the unlikely ""Formula 51"" is a little entertaining, but it could have been much stronger."	0
Sandra Bullock's best dramatic performance yet (is) almost enough to lift (this) thrill-killer cat and mouse.   above his plot by numbers.	0
A feel-good film that doesn't give enough to feel good about.	0
"Adolescents will be adequately served by the ophomoric mix of tricks and slapstick, even if the more lascivious minds might be disappointed by the relative modesty of a film that offers ""topless lessons."""	0
This image of a false identity is so cinematically referential that the end product is a spirit.	0
The picture turns out to be surprisingly anemic disappointment.	0

"With this wafer-thin film on his nimble shoulders, Chan wades through rotten writing, direction and timing with a smile that says, ""If I stay positive, maybe I can channel one of my greatest images, Drunk Master."""	0
So rotten that it's not worth the price of the match to burn every film.	0
In the end, the film sinks into insignificance, saying nothing about Kennedy's assassination, and betraying nothing about the pathology it claims to investigate.	0
starts off ball-loving and stylish, but doesn't keep pace and falls into clichés.	0
Sometimes it makes less sense than the Bruckheimer-style American action flicks it emulates.	0

The whole thing feels like a particularly amateurish episode of Enchanted, set during the spring break.	0
Well done, but without involvement, bloodshed is not a terrible film, just a blunt one - an unrewarding collar for murder.	0
So we've got ten little Indians meeting Friday the 13th through clean and sober, filmed on the set of Carpenter's the Thing and laden with actors you'll most likely find on the next inevitable incarnation of the love ship.	0

What a stifling, unfunny and unoriginal mess!	0
The film is so full of subplots about the various silver stones that it feels more like the pilot episode of a TV series than a feature film.	0
Opera on film is never satisfactory. Art demands live observation. the innate theatricality, which offers thrills and extreme emotions, loses its shine when flattened on screen.	0
Despite all the closed doors, the film is basically juicy.	0
It is narrow-minded, accessible to a select few, repugnant to everyone else, and smugly suggests that a superior moral tone is more important than cinematic.	0
the sweetest leaves a terribly sour taste.	0
It has lost politics and social observation, and is just another situation romance about a couple of juices stuck in an inarticulate script.	0
Definitely bland, painfully slow and unnecessarily confusing   The film, which was not recorded on film but on digital videotape, is often indecipherable.	0

The plot of the film is almost completely witless and nonsensical, carrying each gag two or three times over its limit to create a laugh.	0
It may work as an addictive school treat, but the material never overcomes its questionable satirical ambivalence. This scarlet letter is one.   as in aimless, laborious and arbitrary.	0

is the last thing you would expect from a film with this title or even a Plympton film: boring.	0
In the end, the film seems homogenized and a little contrived, as if we were looking back with rose-tinted glasses on a tattered and ugly past.	0
Chan's stunts are limited and edited to make it look like there really isn't much point in action or even action comedy.	0
The stand-up magic of rock is wearing thin. Hopkins, fills the screen. Action - mechanical.	0

Plot, characters, drama, emotions, ideas - everything is irrelevant to the experience of seeing the Scorpio King.	0
City by the Sea is a dark police thriller with all the dysfunctional family dynamics you could want. But how it turned out is the project's main secret.	0
Whatever the film's sentimental, hypocritical teachings on sexism, its true colours come out in various wet T-shirt and shower scenes.	0
A hybrid teen thriller and crime thriller, Murder by Numbers fits too well into the profile.	0
There's nothing more painful than an unfunny movie that finds that funny.	0
i liked the film superficially while i was never sure what its purpose was.	0
Pity.   that the material is so secondary.	0

Films that leave you amazed that so many talented people were able to participate in such an unwise and poorly implemented idea.	0
Nicks refuses to see Slacker as just another teen movie, which means he can be forgiven for frequently addressing fans of the crass comedy.	0
Nothing in the film is authentic - with the possible exception of Eliza Hurley's breasts.	0
Amid the clichés and premonitions, Cage manages a degree of casual realism.   , which is routinely blown up by Blethyn.	0
Shafer and co-writer Gregory Hinton mostly lack a strong point of view or humour.	0
No cliché escapes the perverse treatment of gang warfare, which is called wild.	0
Eddie Murphy and Owen Wilson have a sweet partnership in a spy movie, but the movie around them is so often almost nothing that its charm doesn't bring much.	0
"In the worst sense of the word, a ""men's film."""	0
There is some good material in her story about a retail clerk who wants more out of life, but the film too often revolves around familiar situations and repeating scenes.	0
It is a lot to ask people to sit still for two hours and look at such a figure, especially when it is portrayed as flat and passive as Phoenix.	0

I wanted to decide what annoyed me most about God is great.   I'm not, and then I realised I just didn't care.	0
Derailed by bad writing and possibly some of the extensive post-production to target young men in the midst of the first testosterone rush.	0
earns high marks for political courage, but barely makes ends meet.	0

Brosnan's finest non-bondlike performance, however, fails to overcome the film's manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes.	0
A film that is best appreciated by those who are prepared to endure its extremely slow rhythms and wait for happiness without much dramatic effect.	0
To me, this sounds like a cruel deception by men of marginal intelligence, with reactionary ideas about women and a complete lack of empathy.	0
tsai may be ploughing the same furrow too often.	0
Flashy gadgets and swirling battle sequences may look cool, but they can't distract from the flawed support structure that keeps the balance.	0
Zigzag might have been richer and more attentive if it had been less dense.	0
[a] crushing disappointment.	0
How can such a cold film claim to express warmth and longing? In truth, it has the whole gist of a porn movie (but none of the pure lust).	0
Nicks and Steinberg are bringing their own creations to market out of pure venality - that's what the old college gave her.	0
Episode II - Attack of the Clones is a technological exercise that lacks juice and joy.	0
The problem with all this is it's not really funny.	0
[denis'] bare-bones narrative is more like a blueprint for a 1970s exploitation picture than the finished product.	0
travels the map thematically and stylistically, borrowing heavily from Lynch, Jeunet and von trier, but finding no spark of his own.	0
Watching this underdramatised but exaggerated film is like watching the transcript of a therapy session brought to life by a joyful doll.	0

an essentially clumsy version of the lightweight image of female empowerment that we have seen for decades	0
The author's followers will probably find it fascinating; others will find it confusing.	0
Writer-director Walter Hill and co-writer David Giller try to create characters from the obvious clichés, but end up using them as punch bags.	0
There is a scientific law here that producers should heed: mediocre films drag on as soon as the plot accelerates; when the explosions begin, they fall apart.	0
An outrageous shot.	0
lush and beautifully photographed (someone suggested that the stills might be a nice coffee table book), but ultimately you leave the theater wondering why these people were important.	0
Unfortunately, an hour-long photo does its title justice Thanks to Williams, all interesting developments are processed in 60 minutes - the rest is just overexposed film waste.	0
cold, sterile and without any colour or heat.	0
The film is nullified by anachronistic edits and the occasional harrowing gaze of a modern theatre audience watching.	0
seems as if someone is going through the movements.	0
"For a film about explosions and death and spies, ""ballistics: ""Separation"" seems as safe as a children's movie. Well, in some cases even the mother dies."	0
Wallace sometimes gets a bit ponderous with his message and has a visual flair that seems far too poetic for our taste.	0
Despite a remarkably strong cast, Hochstapler doesn't do much with his original.	0
cloaks itself in the guise of a dark and quirky comedy, but it is not as quirky as it thinks, and its comedy is generally mean.	0
"Choppy, long documentary about ""the lifestyle."""	0
You hurl yourself through the mud of this supposed psychological thriller in search of meaning, or even conspiracy.	0
A film that puts familiar tropes at the service of clear and conventional historical fiction when it comes to what we ask of the director.	0
"It's a fanboy ""what if?"" on the big screen."	0
The story itself is actually quite vague.	0
It is a hellish, numbing experience to watch, and it does not offer insights that have not been thoroughly discussed in the media before, back in the heyday of Dahmer in the mid-1990s.	0
Wait for payment per view or rent, but don't leave the hair salon out of your hands.	0
A few zingers aside, the writing is indifferent, and Jordan Brady's direction is sober.	0
Every scene drags on, emphasizing the obvious, and the mood is crushed.	0
It would have been nice if the scriptwriters had trusted the audience to understand a complex story and omitted the predictable resolution of the film. Then Nadia's birthday might not be such a bad day.	0
One of those stunningly well-produced, joylessly extravagant images that takes you from one visual wonder to the next, hurried, empty.	0
It simply lacks the self-control needed to guide a loose, poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy.	0
The film enthusiastically takes up the current teen theme of bodily functions and pushes all demographically appropriate comic buttons.	0
It's the funniest American comedy since Graffiti Bridge.	0
The fact that none of the protagonists has a recognizable state hardly matters, because both are merely active brews, characterized by childish weakness and a handful of quirks.	0
What begins as a potential Argentine beauty smells like a room full of sharp flowers.	0
The project's filmmakers forgot to consider anything remotely scary, because they misinterpreted the fatal appeal of high school.	0

Solondz is probably the only one laughing at his own joke	0
Stitch is a bad manners, ugly and destructive little * * * *. Not a sweet factor. The problem is that he has no character, lovable or not.	0
Deep down, I realized the harsh reality of my situation: I left the theater with a lower self.  When I entered.	0
A really funny fifteen-minute short film that went beyond its limits to fill an almost full-length film.	0
Apart from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom. The film gets extra scorn for the fact that it's almost impossible to watch or understand, or the inappropriately poor performance of the poor stephen.	0
It's bad, but certainly not without entertainment value.	0
You wait in vain for a film for its 100 minutes.	0
A work that lacks both meaning and impulse.	0
a faster family film. The upper teens might be cynical. Enjoy smaller, numbered nidlets.	0

It's a road trip drama with too many failures.	0
Most fish stories are a bit strange, but this story should be thrown back into the river.	0
It's all soon gratuitous, as if Schwentke is fulfilling a gross quota for an expected audience, rather than designing the material to fit the story.	0
"""I blame all men for the war,"" [the warden's daughter] tells her father. The film is about as deep as that feeling."	0
It's funny, but it never really takes off.	0
I've seen some bad actors, but lil bow wow takes the cake.	0
In the middle of this picture I started to hate it and of course I felt guilty for it.    Then, miracle after miracle, the film does a somersault.	0
Despite all the complications, everything is surprisingly predictable.	0
It has been 20 years since 48. Eddie Murphy has become a movie star and the man is not a day older. But his showboating personality is certainly getting old.	0
If the wild twos had been taken a step higher, it would have been a camp adventure, one of those films that are so bad they become good. But it wasn't.	0
For an action movie, Ultimate X is the most gabbiest big-screen movie of all time, stuck in a barrage of hype.	0
A cheap Annie with a child who can't act, just an echo of Jordan and a weird actor who screws up old school.	0
It may not be 1970s animation, but everything else about it is straight out of the Saturday morning cartoons, a retread of history, bad writing and the same old silliness.	0
The picture seems uncertain whether it wants to be a sour, all-male evening or a lush, powerless melodrama in the interlude.	0
tends to trick.	0
For almost 21 / 2 hours, the film is far too forgiving.	0
beautiful to look at, but unbearably boring and dull.   A strangely constricted epic.	0
It ends up looking a lot more like a caricature than The Simpsons ever had.	0
With a tighter editorial process and a tighter focus, this material could work, especially as the leading actors are all more than competent, but as it is, personal speed seems idle.	0
does not really add up.	0
It's better suited for the history or biography channel, but there's no arguing about the tone of the film - it leaves a bad taste in the mouth and questions in the mind.	0
A conversation so in love with its exaggerated mythology that it no longer recognizes the audience's need for real characters and compelling plots.	0
a prolonged extrusion of psychopathic mush.	0
Borrowing from other films like this in the most mundane and obvious way.	0
It's surprisingly bland, despite the high dose of odd performances and direction.	0
"a cool, distanced, emotionally distanced piece.   So boring that his slogan should be: ""In space, no one hears you snore."""	0
The characters seem one-dimensional, the film is superficial and should be of interest to its target audience.	0
Sorvino makes the princess seem smug and graphic, and the film only really comes alive when poor Hermocrats and Leontine pathetically compare notes about their burgeoning loves.	0
It's like a drive-by. You can drive right past it without noticing anything special, except a few strange twists, intended or not.	0
Everything - even life on an aircraft carrier - is sentimental.	0
"This would-be James Bond picture for the extreme generation is a big, stupid action movie. Stress ""stupid."""	0
The film has general virtues and, despite many talents involved, seems done with the numbers.	0
If your theme is illusion versus reality, shouldn't reality at least seem passably real?	0
It's a terrible film in every way and absolutely painful to watch.	0
This is a horror story where there is rarely an original idea (or roll or cut or score or anything, really) in sight, and the whole process begs the question why?	0
A fan film that works better on video for the uninitiated with the sound off.	0
too annoyingly quirky and hit with his own style.	0
There's a lot of nothingness at the heart of this little coming-of-age / coming-out story.	0
As much as I laughed, I can't convincingly defend the film as entertainment or even performance art, although you can marvel at the superhuman ability of these guys to endure pain.	0
The kind of dumb stereotype exercise that gives the genre [teen comedy] a bad name.	0
Significantly below average.   It is more likely that a spectator will drown in boredom than that a shudder will run down his back.	0
plays like a bad mix of an overripe episode of Dawson's Creek on TV and a recycled and dumbed down version of the love story.	0
If you don't come into the film with a skateboard under your arm, you don't feel invited to the party.	0
"When the casting call for this film went out, it must have said: ""Look for someone with acting ambition but no sense of pride or shame."""	0
is just not as funny as it should be.	0
"A ""home alone"" film, staged like ""Rosemary's Baby,"" but not as well conceived as any of these films."	0
[Siegel] and co-writers Lisa Bazadona and Grace Woodard have relied too much on convention to create the characters that surround openness.	0
No film could make the single female population more despicable.	0
"""Hey arnold!"" has some visual wit.   but little imagination elsewhere."	0
You go through the motions but the zipper is gone.	0
Sluggish pace and a lack of real storytelling in every way haunt the film, as does life.	0
The tadpole was captured on digital video and the images often appear smeared and blurred to the point of distraction In a better film, you might not have noticed.	0
It's pointless junk like this that makes you appreciate original romantic comedies like punch drunk love.	0
"The film is like a year too late to tap into our reality TV obsession, and even more late to take advantage of the novelty of ""webcast."""	0
"Anyone who has seen George Roy Hill's 1973 film ""The Stinger"" will know the story all too well."	0
the look and the contemporary trappings are right, but otherwise sink into a sea of visual and verbal cliches.	0
It's hard to joke with a handle that has so many real enemies, but notorious c.   still feels like a promising work in progress.	0

A great waste.   Generic.	0
The problem with bread is that it's far too sentimental.	0
A nightly cable explosion masquerading as a thriller about the ruthless social order of college cliques.	0
The music and its roots are not explained.	0
never more than an interested distance.	0
What might turn out to be hilarious craziness at the hands of Woody Allen or Mel Brooks (at least during their heyday in the 1970s) seems lame and second-rate in this first indie feature.	0
Despite slick production values and director Rob Mitchell's tick-tick pace, the end result is two guys screaming in your face for two hours.	0
pretty sucks but has a funny moment or two.	0
They did a good job of painting this family dynamic for the audience, but they tried to squeeze too many elements into the film.	0
A supernatural mystery that doesn't know whether it's going to be a thrilling horror film or a crying melodrama. In the end, it is neither and fails in both endeavours.	0
two poorly intertwined stories drowned in too clever complexity.	0
It's so serious, so overblown and so unbelievably implausible that it begs parody.	0

Almost everything about the film is disturbing, from the grotesque hairpiece worn by Lai's villainous father to the endless action sequences.	0
Writer-director Randall Wallace has bitten off more than he or anyone else could chew, and his film moves like a drunk driver through heavy traffic.	0
It follows the witchcraft formula for an hour, in which something creepy and vague is in progress, and then it goes wrong in the last 30 minutes.	0
You can't shake off the feeling that Crossroads is no more than an hour and a half long commercial for Britney's latest album.	0
Business as usual.	0
There is an epic here, but you have to put it together yourself.	0

Like a circus with three teams, there are plenty of side stories - none memorable.	0
When in doubt, the film creaks the stirring soundtrack, throws in a fish-out-of-water gag and lets the clichéd dialogue burst. Or a dog winks.	0

I didn't find much fascinating about swinging. What they do is a question of arrangements and mind games, without erotic or sensual charge. But the fact that they are doing it makes you think.	0
The spectacle is fine, but there is not enough substance to sustain interest for the full 90 minutes, especially given the weak payout.	0
After collateral damage, you might think that almost every stereotype of a father has dissolved. But no.	0

Even with Harris's strong commitment, the script gives him little to examine effectively Lear's soul-crushing collapse.	0
The story is fake and its characters thin.	0
While the ultra-competent Hitman films such as Pulp Fiction and Short have a sardonic verve for their caustic raison d'etre, who is cletis tout? is an unspeakable and boring wannabe who is looking for exactly this niche.	0

Imagine a film that starts out as seven rip-offs, only to switch to a mixture of the glow, the thing and some naked teenage horror film from the 1980s.	0
Most of the conversations got me packing raw dough into my ears.	0
Costner's warm milk persona is as incongruous as Shadyac's superficial directorial instructions, and some of the overtly silly dialogue would sink Laurence Olivier.	0
It's coherent, well shot and well acted, but it wears you down like a dinner guest presenting his PhD.	0
The director is Kevin Bray, whose crisp, angular cinematography and utter incompetence in acting, sound and tempo clearly distinguish him as a video hero.	0

boring and meandering.	0
Neither a rousing success nor a blinding embarrassment. Still, it sits there like a side dish nobody orders.	0
The sum total of all fears is remarkably confused about motifs and context, depriving them of the dramatic substance that shakes us in our boots (or cinema seats).	0
the film spends more time with tailors than with newcomer mcadams, although their performance is more interesting (and fun) than his.	0
"This cheap - and even less funny - rip-off of the Farrell brothers ""oeuvre is getting way too mushy - and in a relatively short time."	0
It recycles every cliché about gays in an essentially extended soap opera.	0

the exclamation mark seems to be the only grain of joy to be found in this dreary mess.	0
Whichever way you slice it, Mark Wahlberg and Thandie Newton are no Hepburn and Grant, two cinematic icons with ample chemistry.	0
Godard's ode to the wonder of life is a sweeping and incoherent manifesto about the fuzziness of current excesses.   Praise of love remains a ponderous and presumptuous endeavor that is unfocused and tiresome.	0
humourless, self-confident art, created without the glimmer of intelligence or invention	0

Solondz may be convinced that he has something significant to say, but he doesn't talk a conversation I like.	0

A disaster of a drama that was saved only by its winged attackers.	0
"A road trip that makes you think: ""Are we there yet?"""	0
Director Elie Chouraqui, who co-wrote the script, captures the chaotic horror of war, but why bother to submit the truth to the tearful demands of soap opera?	0
He never pushes for insights beyond the superficial tensions of the dynamics he dissects, and the film too easily straddles the contours of expectation.	0

The script? Please.	0

Romantic comedy with a fresh perspective just doesn't seem to be in the current Hollywood schedule.	0
A lame comedy.	0

On its icy face, the new film is a subzero version of Monsters, Inc. without their imagination, visual charm or structure.	0
I can't say enough: this film is about a grown man in pink jammies.	0
It's a pointless action flick with a twist - much better suited for video viewing than multiplex.	0
After a while, the only way for a reasonably intelligent person to get around the country is to think about how an entire section of pop music history could become wet, fuzzy and sticky.	0
We get a few light emotional shivers, but then - strangely - they subside in a contradictory and ultimately unsatisfactory drizzle.	0
Summer is far too fleeting to waste.	0
The film is highly contradictory in its conveyance of its social message, if it even exists.	0
often dwells on the irrelevant as well as on the committed, which gradually raises the question of what time it is. How long is this film?	0
It's a pity Kramer couldn't be there to create the atmosphere.	0

An embarrassingly contrived exercise in magical realism.	0
Demme gets a lot of flavor and spice in his remake of the charade, but he can't hide the fact that he's scavenging up leftovers that aren't as substantial or fresh.	0
This is a heartfelt story.   It's just not very engaging.	0
These self-proclaimed sportsmen and women have slammed their brains into the ground so often and furiously that their ability to explain themselves is as strong as their natural instinct for self-maintenance.	0
"The fact that the ""best part"" of the film comes from a 60-second homage to one of Demme's good films does not bode well for the rest."	0
Richard Pryor dug out his personal horrors and found a treasure chest full of material, but the law usually gives us the gold of fools.	0
The band's drumline performances are hot.   [But] from the point of view of the mere plot, the film is ice cold.	0

plays like an unbalanced mixture of graphic combat material and almost saccharine domestic political interludes that are pure Hollywood.	0
The remake of Mctiernan may be a little lighter - the sober original was as graceful as a tap-dancing rhino - but it's just as boring and obvious.	0
High crimes carry almost no organic intrigue as government / naval / legal secrecy, and that's because the film almost subliminally serves all this stuff as an old-fashioned province of male intrigue.	0
This film is about the worst thing Chan has done in the United States.	0
For me, the explosion essentially ruined - or rather overwhelmed - the fiction of film.	0
This ridiculous film is entirely predictable.	0
An incredibly irritating comedy about thoroughly empty people.   manages to embody the worst excesses of the Nouvelle Vague without any sense of fun or energy.	0
The film sinks ever further into comedic futility.	0
Instead of a balanced film that explains the zeitgeist of X-Games, we get a cinematic postcard that is superficial and unrealistic.	0
The brusqueness of this reactionary thriller is only achieved by the ridiculousness of its premise.	0
I wish it had just gone too far instead of trying to have both.	0
The superior plot line is not enough to carry the dead weight of the other.	0
The film doesn't really care about the thousands of Americans who die abominably, it cares about how Ryan meets his future wife and starts with the police.	0
Strange, bentley and hudson stare and sniff, or try in vain to prove that the intensity of movie stars can overcome bad hair.	0
After an hour and a half of wondering - sometimes amusing, sometimes impatient - what this extremely unconventional film is supposed to be, you realize that the answer is as conventional as possible.	0
'linklater fans or discerning guys who want to appear avant-garde will join this project.	0

A summary of the plot does not do justice to the horror of the film, which is expressed too painfully in the execution.	0
Every conceivable mistake a director could make in making operas has been made here.	0
"Snoots will no doubt stand up for his cause, belting out hackneyed standbys like ""Masterpiece"" and ""Triumph"" and all that, but seldom does an established filmmaker waste viewers ""time with such fervour."	0

endlessly dreary, not to mention boring.	0
Things get really strange, if not terribly scary: the film is all nonsense and no content.	0
