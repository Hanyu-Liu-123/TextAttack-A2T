prurient playthings aside, there's little to love about this english trifle.	0
this is a the wreck of an old film - - a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force - feed james burns into the mindless xxxemia and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the drain in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs.	0
the film leaves lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle over dark, decadent truffle.	0

for anyone who grew up on disney's orchestral treasure plantation, or remembers the 1934 victor fleming classic, this one feels like an impostor.	0
a clutchy, indulgent and pretentious travelogue and diatribe against three.. well, just stuff. watching scarlet diva, one is not for titillation, without insight or both. instead, we just get messy anger, a movie as personal therapy.	0
meandering, sub - aquatic mess : it's so bad it's good, but only after you slide in on a free ride.	0

writer - director walter hill and co - writer david giler try making boxing characters out of the obvious cliches, but wind up using them as punching cards.	0
there's a scientific law to be discerned here that producers would be well to heed : mediocre ceilings start to drag as soon as the action speeds up ; when the ceilings start, they fall to pieces.	0
a cockeyed shot all the way.	0
lush and beautifully photographed ( she suggested the film might make a nice coffee table book ), but ultimately you'll leave the theater wondering why these people mattered.	0
unfortunately, the hourwave lives down to the title. thanks largely to williams, all these interesting developments are processed in 60 minutes - - the rest is just an overexposed waste of film.	0
cold, sterile, lacking any color or warmth.	0
the film is followed by anachronistic quick edits and occasional jarring glimpses of a modern theater audience watching the accident unfold.	0

a film which presses the herzog tropes into the service of a limpid and conventional science fiction, when really what we demand of the director is to be mesmerizing.	0
it's my fan of'what if?'brought to life on the the screen.	0
the story itself is possibly quite vapid.	0
it's a hellish, numbing academic period scandal, and it doesn't offer any insights that haven't been thoroughly debated in the media yet, especially in the dahmer heyday of the mid -'90s.	0
wait for pay per view or rental but don't get barbershop out of hand.	0

one of those staggeringly well - produced, joylessly extravagant pictures that keep whooshing you from one visual marvel to the next and hastily, emptily.	0
nair just doesn't have the necessary self - control to mouth a taut, poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy.	0

a rather funny fifteen - minute short stretched beyond its mandate to become an almost feature - length film.	0
aside from the fact that the film methodically uses the website slashdotcom. com or the improperly hammy performance from poor stephen rea, the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand.	0
it is bad, but certainly not as terrible as entertainment.	0
for its 100 minutes running time, you'll pretend in vain for a movie to happen.	0
a music that lacks both a bark and a strong pulse.	0
a faster paced family flick. where teens must get cynical. smaller numbered kidlets will enjoy.	0
while this film has an'a'list cast and some strong supporting players, the tale - - like its central figure, vivi - - is already a little bit harder to love.	0
it's a road - trip drama with too many wrong turns.	0
the fish stories are a little weird, but this was one that should be thrown back in the river.	0
it's very gratuitous before long, as if schwentke is fulfilling a gross - out quota for an anticipated audience demographic instead of shaping the commitment to fit the story.	0
""" helps blame all men for war, "" [ the warden's daughter ] tells her father. the movie is about as deep as that sentiment."	0

... a low rate movie featuring some dead who can't act, only echoes of jordan wolfe and weirdo actor crispin glover screwing things up old school.	0
it might not be 1970s type, but everything else about it is roots from the saturday morning cartoons a retrenched story, bad movies, and the same old silliness.	0
the picture seems eastwood whether it wants to have an acidic all - male all about hardened or a brooding, swooning melodrama in the intermezzo strain.	0
tends to pluck.	0
a loosely 21 / 2 hours, the film is way tootful still.	0
gorgeous to look at. insufferably tedious and turgid... but curiously con guably epic.	0
it is much more like a cartoon in the end than the simpsons ever has.	0
with a tighter editorial process and firmer direction this material could work, especially since the actresses in the lead roles are all less than competent, but as is their personal velocity seems to be furling in neutral.	0
doesn't really add up to much.	0
it's better suited for the movies or biography channel, but there's no arguing the tone of the movie - it leaves a bad taste in your mouth and questions on your mind.	0
forte entertainment was in love with its overinflated mythology that it no longer recognizes the markings of moviegoers for real characters and compelling stories.	0
a prolonged extrusion of psychopathic personality.	0
borrows from other movies like it in the most ordinary and obvious fashion.	0
it's surprisingly bland with the heavy doses of weird performances and direction.	0
a lonely, remote, emotionally distant piece. yeah. so dull that its tagline should be :'in it, no one can hear her snore. '	0
the characters seem one - dimensional, and the film is superficial and will probably be of use primarily on its target audience.	0
sorvino makes the princess seem animated and cartoonish, and the film only really comes alive when poor herlke bones and leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours.	0
it's like a drive - by. you can drive right into it without noticing the lights, save for a few comic turns, intended and otherwise.	0
everything - - even life on an aircraft carrier - - was sentimentalized.	0

a fan film that for the uninitiated plays better on video following the caucus turned down.	0
too infuriatingly quirky and taken into its own style.	0
there's a whole heap of tissue at the core of this slight coming - of - age / coming - out tale.	0
as much as i laughed throughout the movie, i cannot mount a cogent defense against the film as entertainment, or as performance art, although the movie does leave you marvelling at these aliens'superhuman capacity to withstand pain.	0
the kind of dumbed - down exercise in stereotypes that gives the [ romantic comedy ] genre its the name.	0
distinctly sub - par... more likely to drown a viewer in boredom than to send dangerous shivers down his spine.	0
plays like a bad blend of an overripe episode of tv's dawson's creek and a recycled and dumbed - down version of love boat.	0
unless you come in to the film with a corkboard under your arm, you're going to feel like you weren't invited to the party.	0
when the casting call for the movie went out, it must have read'for anyone with acting ambition but no sense of pride or shame. '	0
just it's as weird as it ought to be.	0
"a "" home alone "" film thus is scored like "" rosemary's baby, "" but is not as well - conceived as either of those films."	0

` hey arnold!'` some visual wit... but little imagination elsewhere.	0
she's going through the motions, but the zip is gone.	0
a sluggish pace and lack of genuine narrative hem the movie in every bit as much as life hems in the spirits of these young women.	0
a low - budget affair, tadpole was shot on digital technologies, and the images often appear smeary and blurry, to the avoid of distraction. then again, in a better light, you might not have noticed.	0

what might have emerged as hilarious lunacy in the hands of woody guthrie or mel brooks ( at least during their'70s heyday ) comes across as hilarious and sophomoric in this debut indie feature.	0
despite slick production values and director roger michell's tick - to soho,, the final effect is like having two guys yelling in your ear for two hours.	0
pretty often sucks, but has a funny moment or two.	0
they do a good job with painting this family dynamic of the dialogue but they tried to squeeze too many elements into the film.	0

swimfan, a notable attraction, eventually goes overboard with a phony melodramatic denouement in which a high school swimming pool substitutes for a bathtub.	0
claims to sort out bad guys from the future, which is its essential problem.	0
purposefully shocking in its eroticized approach, if unintentionally dull in its lack of poetic frissons.	0
feels like pieces a bunch of other, better movies slapped together.	0
almost everything about the film is unsettling, from the preposterous hairpiece worn by lai's villainous father to the endless action sequences.	0
