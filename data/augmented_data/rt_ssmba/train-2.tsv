the whole thing comes off like a particularly amateurish episode of bewitched that takes place during winter break.	0
well made but uninvolving the blood struggles isn't a terrible movie, just a stultifyingly obvious one - like an rerewarding collar for a murder mystery.	0
so we got ten little indians meets friday the 13th by way of clean and sober, filmed on the set of carpenter's swamp thing and loaded with actors you're most likely to find on the next inevitable incarnation of the love boat.	0
