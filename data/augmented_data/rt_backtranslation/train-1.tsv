While the story is undeniably difficult to follow, Iwais's beautiful images seduce.	1
If you can overcome the taboo, it's worth it.	1
A beautiful film.   elegant, funny and unashamedly romantic beneath a primitive exterior.   Very pleasant in itself, but not really true to the complexity of the source.	1

You pay attention to that feeling of openness, the little surprises.	1
"Director Peter Kosminsky gives these women a forum to demonstrate their acting ""sideburns,"" and they exploit them."	1

Remove Spider-Man from its environment and it's obvious that this is a summer movie that satisfies.	1
The whole mildly enjoyable outing - the R stands for brief nudity and a gruesome corpse - depends not on its self-referential hot air, but on everyone's inspired performance.	1
In a wonderfully strange film, Heaven is deeply preoccupied with morality, but refuses to explain things to viewers.	1
The Emperor's Club, in its own quiet way ruthless, finds one of our most conservative and narrow-minded film traditions and gives it a new structure, new relevance, new reality.	1
It is truly terrible and heartbreaking, but one whose lessons are worth repeating as often as possible.	1
Though intrepid in exploring an attraction that traverses sexual identity, Ozpetek falls short when it comes to showing us Anthony's true emotions.   But at least his secret life makes you think.	1
There is no question that this is a serious piece of work by a great director who has something new to say about how we often get involved in the flip-flop of courtship when we should be playing.	1
The message of such considerations - intentional or not - is that while no art emerges from a vacuum, many artists live in one.	1
The energetic frontman is in a good mood, and his enthusiasm can hardly be resisted, even if the filmmakers don't come up with anything original in slapstick sequences.	1
the otherwise good-natured kind of Mr. Actions, with its embrace of sheer kindness and cameos less than likely.   The film certainly stands out from anything that was previously associated with Sandler.	1
The film is really brilliant. It is philosophy, illustrated by everyday events.	1
Stylishly staged with verve.	1
gives the French coming-of-age genre a fascinating touch.	1

"Even if you've seen ""Stomp"" (the stage show), you have to see it!"	1

It's so simple it borders on superficiality, but keeping the film from cheap mediocrity is its crack.	1
full of the nefarious, ironic humor that comes from Yiddish culture and language.	1
A time machine, a journey back to childhood, when worries melted away in the dark theatre and films had the ability to fascinate, marvel and entertain.	1
Rubbel's humorous-tendentious intervention into the controversy of who wrote and who wrote.	1
Cantet beautifully illuminates what it sometimes means to be indoors and look outdoors.	1
k-19: The widower is a great yarn.	1
It's as raw and action-packed an experience as a seat in the ring in a tough men's competition.	1
evokes the frustration, awkwardness and euphoria of growing up without relying on the usual tropes.	1
A brilliant gag at the expense of those who paid for it and those who paid for it.	1
visually striking and viscerally repellent.	1
overcomes its visual ugliness with a sharp script and strong performances.	1
Touch!	1
Amazingly clever and moving.   It could be a historically significant and masterfully made work.	1
beautifully crafted and coolly disturbing.   expertly depicts the atmosphere of crime.	1

Time is a beautiful film, an interesting and sometimes gripping film about loss and loneliness	1
A fascinating look at the French film industry during the German occupation; its most delightful moments come when different characters express their quirky interior.	1
"A good documentary differs from a mediocre one in that the better film makes its subject interesting for those who do not belong to its supposed target audience. By these standards, ""Scratch"" is a pretty decent documentary."	1
fubar is very funny, but not always in a loud way.	1
a diverse and amazingly articulate occupation of Palestinian and Israeli children	1
A light but entertaining documentary.	1
"""The film is crass, direct and deadly.   An unnatural calm that is occasionally interrupted.   Tantrums and later violent jealousy."	1
An impressive hybrid.	1
Call it the full Monty on Ice, the formula of the underdog sports team Redux.	1
unfolds in a restrained, organic way that encourages one to accept it as life and follow its flow.	1

The heat of the moment prevails. It cooks in a low, smoky and inviting sizzle.	1
A compelling story, well told.	1

A compelling pre-Wwii drama with vivid characters and a warm, moving message.	1

By turns touching, intoxicatingly amusing, uncomfortable and, yes, even sexy, it is never again a welcome and heartwarming addition to the genre of romantic comedy.	1
"Worse than ""Silence of the Lambs"" better than ""Hannibal"""	1
Those who have not seen the film lately may be surprised by the diversity of tones in Spielberg's work. Much of it is funny, but there are some surprising, surreal moments.	1

An entertaining mix of historical drama and flat farce that will please history fans.	1
The arctic light of Canada shines brightly on this frozen tundra soap opera that breathes extraordinary life into the private existence of the Inuit.	1
The fluid movement is astounding on many levels - including the physical demands on Büttner - and implies in its wake the irreversible flow of history.	1
by turns hilarious and sad, aggravating and emotional, devastating and joyful. It's a masterpiece.	1
The film's messages of tolerance and diversity are not particularly original, but you can't help getting carried away by the sympathetic characters.	1

Yes, it's as good as you remember. Even better, in fact.	1
Hartley adds enough whimsical and satirical accents to the script to keep the film entertaining.	1

Insanely funny! I haven't laughed like that in years!	1
Anyone who has ever suffered under a music teacher will no doubt have fantasised about the miserable, oppressed and twisted private life her tormentor earned. These people will really love the piano teacher.	1

It may not be the story, but what if it is? But it's one of the most enjoyable and satisfying nights in cinema I've had for some time.	1
"If ""lilo & stitch"" isn't the most edgy piece of Disney animation to hit the big screen, this first movie to use a watercolor background since ""Dumbo"" is surely the most original in years."	1
This may be Dover Kosashvili's feature debut, but it looks terribly like life - dark, clumsy and ironic.	1

"Bowling for Columbine ""remains a disturbing and thoughtful film."	1
Even if it is imbued with the sensitivity of a video director, it does not provide completely empty entertainment	1

an average child's empowerment fantasy with slightly above average brains	1
Confessions are not always conclusive, but they are sharply funny and surprisingly touching, so hold the gong.	1

A sentimental but irresistible portrait of three ageing sisters	1

Painting an unabashedly romantic picture of a nation whose songs spring directly from people's lives, the film extols the Marxist dream of an honest working people who have little to show for their work, who live harmoniously and to whom songs are sung.	1
is the most brilliant work in the genre since the 1984 unabridged version of Sergio Leone's flawed but harrowing American story.	1
It examines the fragile, complex relationships closely and insistently.	1
Not a bad choice, provided that.   The air conditioning in the theatre works perfectly.	1
A beautiful effort, an interesting subject, some fascinating characters and a sad ending. The big finish was certainly not something Galinsky and Hawley could have planned.   But being a good documentary maker is part of being there when the rope breaks.	1
it must be the end of the world: the best movie so far this year is a franchise sequel starring Wesley Snipes.	1
There are moments of hilarity.	1
Refreshing.	1
a hypnotic portrait of this sad, compulsive life	1
[while the last subway] was more melodramatic, confined to a single theater and its strategies and deceptions, while Tavernier is more concerned with the entire period of history.	1

a brisk, reverential and subtly different sequel.	1
A film I loved at first sight and, more importantly, love in memory.	1

This is lightweight filmmaking, but it's enjoyable enough - and bubbles with attractive men.	1
At its most basic, this cartoon adventure is so exhilarating.	1
Fans of the critically acclaimed band wilco will marvel at the sometimes murky, always brooding look with which I try to break your heart	1
The film presents haunting and dangerously honest revelations about the people and machines behind the curtains of our planet.	1
[Gosling's] combination of explosive physical energy and compelling intelligence helps to create a complex, unpredictable character.	1

Fulford-Wierzbicki.   She cleverly captures the teenagers who are clever beyond their years.	1
A wild ride full of energy and excitement for at least three films	1
It's a cool event for the whole family. Maybe not a classic, but a film that children want to see again and again.	1

The film is not as terrible as the synergistic impulse that produced it.	1
A typically observant, carefully nuanced and intimate French coming-of-age film, it is an encouraging debut, but has an unnecessarily bleak ending, too heavy for anything that preceded it.	1
Less a confrontation with neo-Nazism than a confrontation with the nature of faith.	1
a moving and weighty account of a family's attempts to heal after a child dies	1
I don't think most people who loved the paradise of 1989 will prefer this new version. But I do.	1
A zingy crowd favourite, with which open-minded Elvis fans (but by no means all) will have fun.	1
Digging and turning are among the main reasons brown sugar is so sweet and sexy.	1
It's exciting, extremely fast and ultimately.   I dare say entertaining!	1
the captivating performances of the incredibly flexible cast make love a joy.	1
Like Nadja, a Russian shipping bride who comes to America and doesn't speak a word of English, Kidman holds the film together with a very cheesy performance that gradually piles more layers.	1
With an unflappable air of decadent urbanity, Everett remains a perfect, ferocious actor, and a relaxed Firth shows impeccable comic skills.	1

is very well written and directed with brutal honesty and respect for the audience.	1

A surprisingly charming and even witty match with the best of Hollywood's comic adaptations.	1
This is a terrific horror film.	1
Adaptation is just brilliant.	1
Thirteen conversations about one thing is a little gem.	1
the pleasure of reading my lips is like seeing a row of perfect black pearls clicking into a string. We are attracted by the dark radiance.	1
A haunting tale of murder and mayhem.	1
I love the opening scenes of a wintry New York city in 1899. The cinematic poetry shows the charm of the old world of the city before machines change almost everything.	1
It's hard to imagine anyone managing to steal a movie from not only the charismatic rising star Jake Gyllenhaal, but also the accomplished Oscar winners Susan Sarandon, Dustin Hoffman and Holly Hunter, but newcomer ellen pompeo manages the feat with flying colours.	1

A huge piece of work.	1
a delicious, if small, pastry of a film.	1
Although obviously aimed at children, the country bears bears.   should entertain parents about the low moaning-guffaw ratio.	1
Labute masterfully balances both traditional and modern stories in a way that never overwhelms the other. Something for everyone.	1
Irwin is so serious that it is hard to resist his appeals to conserve wildlife and respect its environment. There are much worse messages for a young audience that is probably perfectly happy with the sloppy slapstick comedy.	1
Leigh manages a dramatic slap in the face that is painful and refreshing.	1
It is not about fear, but about a mood in which a menacing, omnipresent and unknown threat lurks just below the proceedings and creates an almost constant tension.	1

A fascinating insight into an island world that belies many clichés and presents a group of dedicated artists.	1
It is one thing to read about the ongoing - and unprecedented - construction project or rail against it. It is quite another to feel physically trapped in this process.	1
contradicts everything we expect from film today. Instead of treating conventional material in a conventional way, the secretary takes the most unexpected material and processes it in unexpected ways.	1
would I have been more excited when I heard that apollo 13 would be released in imax? In a word: no.	1
Murderous maids have it all, not least the brilliant performances of the testers.   and Permentier.	1
Filmmaker Stacy Peralta has a flashy cutting style that doesn't always harmonize with Sean Penn's monotonous narrative style, but he respects the material without sentient it.	1
"There are a few things that elevate ""fame"" above most of its kind, especially the mere presence of Duvall."	1
It's easy against the shower and hard against the atmospheric whimsy, and there are moments of breathtakingly strange behavior - yet I found it strangely attractive.	1

tsai ming-liang's spirits are painfully aware of their non-being.	1
The songs from the second floor jump from one captivating image to another and have the pleasant randomness of a very living dream, thus managing to be captivating, amusing and disturbing at once.	1

It's a perfect show of respect just for one of those underrated professionals who deserve it but rarely get it.	1
For all its twists, some of which border on bizarre at the end of the film, Bloodwork is a strong character-driven piece.	1
The plot may be 127 years old, but it's not the first time.   The desperate vision of corruption within the Catholic establishment could not be more timely.	1
This in-depth study of important developments in the computer industry should make it necessary to visit computer science faculties for years to come.	1
It shows us a piece of life that is very different from our own and yet immediately recognizable.	1
a wonderfully speculative character study, which made up for its rather slow start by drawing me into the picture.	1
has its share of compelling images.	1

A gripping picture of law enforcement and an infernal, nasty journey into an urban hell.	1
Director Douglas mcgrath takes it with all the half-hearted zeal of an eighth-grade boy dealing with reading.	1
is a document of what it felt like to be a New Yorker - or really a human being - in the weeks after September 11.	1
I'm generally not a big fan of cartoons from TV shows, but hey arnold! The film is clever, quirky and even gritty enough to overcome my resistance.	1
[testud] acts with the ferocious intensity of young Bette Davies, without much help from the script (competent but extremely fleeting).	1
It is a film destined to attract a wide summer audience through word-of-mouth and, not far away, find a place among the studio's animated classics.	1

Another love story in a remarkable series of sweeping images from 2002 that have revived the love genre.	1

[F] rom the performances and cinematography to the outstanding soundtrack and the unconventional narrative, the film is alive and admirable on many levels.	1
Shiri is an action film that promises suspense, but also has a strong dramatic and emotional pull that gradually spreads to the audience.	1

a powerful exploration of hypocrisy, self-awareness, self-hatred and self-determination.	1
This is not a retooled genre piece, the story of a guy and his weapon, but an endearingly idiosyncratic work.	1
All in all, it is a very entertaining, thought-provoking film with a simple message: God is love.	1
It may not be a great piece of cinematography, but its power comes from the point of view of its soul, as well-meaning paternalism masks a social injustice that is at least represented in this case.	1

Even if it drags on, we are forced to think about how stunning his visual imagination is	1

a life-size re-creation of those Jack Chick cartoons that always ended with some hippie being thrown into the lake of fire.	1
The grainy photography is an otherwise delightful comedy of errors.	1
This film is not a love letter to the murdered rappers, but a mockery - a call for justice for two crimes from which many of us have not yet recovered.	1
The film impresses with the sight and sounds of the wondrous beats the world offers.	1
Daily struggles and simple joys usurp the message of the sermon, so that when the credits roll on the end of the knock, there is a warm, fuzzy feeling.	1
Not at all original or even memorable, but as inner-city matinee candy it does not disappoint.	1
"""Slap in the face"" is a small but rewarding comedy that focuses on today's southern adolescence and never fails."	1
Cremaster 3 is a hard pill to swallow and a small miracle of self-expression.	1
Sex is one of those films that is meant to confuse.	1

Perhaps not the best, but definitely the best.	1
entertaining, fast-paced and hard-hitting documentary.	1
Samples are often more fascinating than the results. The last dance, for all its flaws, fulfils one facet of its mission by making me wonder if this is true.	1
The film's constant melancholy and calm narrative are masterfully controlled. But in an attempt to capture the novel's deeper intimate resonances, the film ironically distanced us from the characters.	1
This is a breathtaking film, a unique tour de force.	1
[Cho's face is] an amazing slapstick instrument that creates a smorgasbord of vivid mug shots.	1

a static and sugary half-hour extracurricular special on interreligious understanding, lasting 90 minutes	0
But when you look at the chemistry between Freeman and Judgment, this film is almost worth watching. Almost.	0
an overbearing and ultimately empty investigation of a sick and evil woman	0
The country has no scenes that upset or frighten young viewers. Unfortunately, there is almost nothing in this flat effort that would amuse or entertain them.	0
The cumulative effect of this 65-minute trifle is more like being trapped while a strange relative records the video of the family holiday to Stonehenge. It doesn't take long, and you wait desperately for the evening to end.	0
The figures are never more than sketches.   , which frustratingly leaves any real emotional connection or identification out of reach.	0
Matteis's underdeveloped efforts here are nothing more than a comfortable conveyor belt of brooding personalities running around as if they were returning from the camp of tribal characters - a sleepy drama beguiled by his own overbearing self-examination.	0
Only in his last surprising shots does the rabbit-proof fence find the authority it seeks.	0
"is not as sharp as the original.   Despite some visual advantages, ""Blade II"" just doesn't cut."	0
plays like a poorly edited 91-minute trailer (and) the director doesn't seem to get a coherent rhythm going. In fact, it doesn't even seem like she tried.	0
"Maybe he thought, ""hey, the movie about the baseball-playing monkey was worse."""	0
What you expect, you get.   The bar for expectations was not raised above the sixth grade.	0
Barry Sonnenfeld owes the pug a lot of time	0
The biggest problem with Roger Avary's revolt against the mpaa is that, despite the director's fame, he made a film that hardly shocked, hardly interesting and, above all, hardly anything.	0
so riddled with unanswered questions that it takes giant leaps in confidence just to watch her flounder.	0
I went up to the usher and said that if she had to sit through it again, she should ask for an increase.	0
Serious but ponderous.	0
If Sini's character had a brain, his ordeal would be over in five minutes, but instead the plot does everything it can to get in his way.	0
Too slow for a younger audience, too flat for an older one.	0
"There's a reason the studio didn't offer a preview. ' The Adventures of Pluto-Nash ""is a big stinker."	0
A punchline without a premise, a joke that consists exclusively of musty memories of half-dimensional figures.	0
takes one character that we do not like and another one that we do not believe, and puts them in a battle of wills that is impossible to care about and not particularly funny.	0
The things this film is trying to get audiences to buy won't resonate with most intelligent viewers.	0
Even if the tantalizing prospect of many sober young actors in a film about campus depravity did not fade amid the conscious, tedious ugliness, it would be tiresome by Avary's failure to construct a story with even a hint of dramatic interest.	0
sitting through the last reel (spoiler alert!) is considerably less charming than listening to a four-year-old with a penchant for hyperbole talk about his Halloween trip to the haunted house.	0
confuses his message with an ultimate desire to please, and distorting into a notion of expectation is the last thing any of these three actresses or their characters deserve	0
Deathly boring, pointless meditation on losers in a remote hotel	0
With this new rollerball technology, sense and sensitivity have been overrun by what can only be described as robotic emotion.	0
One can only assume that the jury that awarded Star Hoffman's brother Gordy the Waldo Salt screenplay prize at the 2002 Sundance Festival honored an attempt to do something other than actually remove him	0
A film that should be prescribed more than recommended - visually bland like a dentist's waiting room, complete with soothing muzak and a cushion of predictable narrative rhythms.	0
Sex, ironically, has little to do with the story, which says something about how lame it is to shirk responsibility and that you should never, ever leave a big dog alone with a toddler. But no matter, the tits are fantastic	0
The script deals with big, heavy subjects in a bland, superficial way that offers no insight into why good things happen to bad people, for example.	0
is such a perfect portrait of alienation that it will surely succeed in alienating most viewers.	0
The code talkers deserved more than a hollow acknowledgement.	0
skip the movie and buy the Philips glass CD.	0

Graceful Ceos meet at a rustic retreat and pee against a tree Can you bear the laughter?	0
boring and mechanical, somehow like a very stupid museum piece	0
There is no point of view, no contemporary interpretation of John's pre-feminist predicament, so we think the only reason to make the film is that current standards allow a lot of nudity.	0
Beware the quirky Brit-Com. They can and will go from strangely humorous to tiresomely sentimental	0

The gags and the script are a mix.	0
A terrible Iranian drama.   As much fun as a grumpy ayatollah in a cold mosque	0
Narratively, every day is a mess.	0
There is no point in drawing the bare bones of Byatt's plot to a bland Hollywood romance.	0
Directors John Musker and Ron Clements, the team behind The Little Mermaid, have produced sparkling retinal candies, but they are unable to generate much emotional resonance in the cold vacuum of space.	0
A lady's heart may be in the right place, but he needs to get his head out of his ass	0
There is no doubt that this is a highly ambitious and personal project for egoists, but it is also one that, alongside its best work, feels clumsy and confused.	0
Despite fancy touches, it rarely seems to be about kicking around a raison d'etre as fresh as their young guns.	0
It's all pretty tame. The most offensive thing about the film is that Hollywood expects people to pay for it.	0
The film is a mess from start to finish.	0
The problem with making this queen a thoroughly modern girl is that it also makes her look foolish and superficial, rather than, as was more likely, a victim of mental illness.	0
I'm not saying the Ice Age doesn't have pretty pictures, but there's not enough substance in history to breathe life into them.	0
In telling a largely untold story, bui chooses something that is ultimately suspiciously familiar.	0
The plot is nothing more than cauldron clichés from start to finish, and the script assumes that not only would the target audience lose subtlety, but that it's too stupid to realize that they've seen this very film a hundred times already	0
Production of brain dead.	0
Some episodes work, others don't.	0
beautifully filmed and well acted.   admittedly problematic in its narrative particularities.	0
She will earn her share of the Christmas cake, although the film makes one thing very clear: she is a pretty woman, not a working girl.	0
Rymer doesn't trust laughter - and doesn't give due respect to devotees of the entire Dead Undead genre, who deserve more from a vampire picture than some flashy special effects.	0
"The film's soprano gags are not only incredibly old-fashioned and unfunny, they also show how desperate the makers of this sequel to ""We Do It for Money"" were."	0
Wow. I haven't been so disappointed in a movie for a long time.	0
is over-long and not well acted, but the writer, producer and director adam watstein has finished it.	0
It is a sign of poverty how Nettelbeck sees working women - or at least this working woman - for whom she shows little sympathy.	0
Watching Harris dissolve physically and emotionally throughout the film has a certain sharpness to it, given his recent death, but Boyd's film offers little else.	0
It is also curious that this film, like the similarly poorly timed Antitrust Law, is just as bad on a fraction of the budget.	0
"""Ejemplo de una cinta en que no importa el talento de su reparto o lo interesante que pudo haber resultado su premisa, pues el resultado es francamente aburrido y, por momentos, deplorable."""	0
will probably be one of those films that barely look at the radar screen of 2002.	0
The problem is not that everything is derivative, because many funny films recycle old tropes. The problem is that van Wilder doesn't do much that is actually funny with the material.	0
Infidelity is not interesting at all.	0
None of this is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think.	0
a processed comedy.	0
As is customary in disused screen series, Star Trek: Nemesis is even more impressive than a 65th class reunion, where only eight surviving members turn up - and there's nothing to drink	0
Fails as a dystopian film, as a retooling of Fahrenheit 451 and even as a rip-off The Matrix	0
Full of the kind of obnoxious chatter that only self-conscious neurotics do.	0
An erotic thriller that is neither too erotic nor too exciting.	0
Like Bartleby, the film is something of a stiff upper lip - an extra-dry office comedy that seems twice as long as its 83 minutes.	0
with its parade of almost constantly wasted figures.   Margarita feels like a hazy high that takes too long to shake.	0
If you value time and money, find an escape clause and avoid this banal, predictable repetition.	0
The director and her capable cast seem caught up in a heady maelstrom of new, age-inspired good intentions, but the magic they exert is not in the least fascinating.	0
"Everything is tied to the groove of a New York dating comedy, which is simplistic about ""issues."""	0
A dramatic comedy, as pleasantly dishonest and patronising as any Hollywood fluff	0
The cameo-packed m: i-2 spoofing title sequence is the funniest 5-minute story of this agent comedy.   Then microphones pop up and ruin everything.	0
It's so silly that you wouldn't be surprised if Ba, Murdock and the rest of the A-team were chasing around in a black and red van.	0
The 50 or so lovebirds are too immature and unattractive to care about.	0
Ingenious as the conceit is, this is one of those rare images that one searches for throughout, in the fervent hope that the rich promise of the script will be realised on screen. It never is, not completely.	0
Even in summer, the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise opportunities.	0
What with all the sweeping statements and rudeness about vanity, the worries of the rich and the sudden wisdom, the film becomes a sermon for most of its run.	0
A lousy film.	0
As playful as the film tries to make sense of its title character, there remains a huge gap between the creepy, neatly cut Dahmer (Jeremy Renner) and devilish plots that no serious schoolbook psychology can bridge.	0
Defiant, peevish and clumsy.	0
The four feathers are definitely horse feathers, but if you know that, you will have fun in this cinematic sandbox.	0
Condescension seeps out of every pore.	0

There is no hook, no wise crackle or stubborn cynicism in George Hicklooper's direction.	0
Mesmerisingly boring.	0
Although this saga would be great to read, it is an expensive canvas that only a genius should touch.	0
She has a lot to laugh about. She doesn't have much more.   especially in moral terms.	0

Confusion is one of my least favourite feelings, especially when I have to put up with it.	0

It may well play as a double act with mainstream foreign porridge like my thick Greek wedding	0
When you reach the final, you will probably wonder why you are watching all these stumbles and poses.	0
Journalistically questionable, inept and often deadly boring.	0
Locking the primitive killer in a high-tech space station triggers a Pandora's box of special effects that range from cheesy to cheesy.	0
At its best, it's a Black Hawk with more heart. At its worst, it is Rambo-meets-John Ford.	0

Calculated waste.	0
This movie.   does not deserve the energy needed to describe how bad it is.	0
With or without ballast tanks, the k-19 sinks into a deep ford.	0
Director Oliver Parker works so hard to whip life into the realms of seriousness that he's probably pulled one muscle or another.	0
You might be shocked to find that real life is boring.	0
It's not nearly as fresh and enjoyable as its predecessor, but there are enough highlights to prevent it being a waste of time.	0
Walsh cannot quite negotiate the many contradictions in Janica's behavior, or compensate for them with mere charm.	0
this tenth film in the series looks and feels tired.	0
She leans back and offers almost no insight into her fascinating subject.	0
I found myself feeling increasingly frustrated and detached, while my beliefs became increasingly odious.	0
one of the strangest and most inexplicable sequels in film history.	0
There is nothing to gain by watching them. It's not scary. It hates its characters. It finds no way to entertain or enthuse its viewers.	0
"Fear pervades the entire narrative, todd solondz ""often comic but ultimately cowardly autocriticism."	0
The power struggles between victims and predators settle into an undifferentiated rhythm of artificial tension.	0
Absolutely awful.	0
The Ice Age treads predictably familiar ground, making the film a passable family film that won't win many fans 12 years and up.	0
Although the film is well intentioned, you could rent the original and get the same love story and parable.	0
too stupid and secondary to catch its target audience.	0
"The video work is so grainy and rough, so dependent on being ""naturalistic,"" rather than carefully lit and set up, that it is exhausting to watch."	0
Really awful.	0
a cleverly designed but ultimately hollow dummy.	0
Before it gets to the really good stuff, it gets tangled up in batting humour.	0
The film is an agonisingly exciting premise, hampered by uneven dialogue and plot.	0
It is Tommy's job to clean the peepers around them, and after looking at this one you will feel like mopping up.	0
Rifkin undoubtedly fancies himself something of a hubert selby Jr. , but there is not an ounce of honest poetry in his entire script; it is simply crude and relentlessly exploitable.	0
Fluffy and prone.	0
Such a bad film that its happiest viewers will sit next to one of those ignorant pinheads who talk throughout the series.	0
If you go to the theatre expecting a scary, action-packed cooler, you may soon be looking for a character. An exit sign then.	0
limits the attraction of those who like explosions, sadism and seeing people beating themselves to pieces.	0
The dialogue, despite its synchronization, is choppy and monosyllabic.	0
a fully equipped road trip version of Mom's family.	0
What you end up getting is the vertical boundary of surfing in movies - memorable stunts with plenty of downtime in between.	0
Thieves don't care about cleverness, wit or any other kind of intelligent humour.	0
Bigelow manages the sequences of the nuclear crisis evenly, but softens the drama when it builds tension, dragging out too many scenes toward the end that should go fast.	0
There is undeniable fun in movies that are crammed with movie references, but the fun diminishes if nothing else happens.	0
Imagine Kevin Smith, the blasphemous villain in a suburban jersey, if you took away most of his budget and sense of humor. the result could look vulgar.	0
suffers from a lack of clarity and boldness demanded by a monstrous and pathetic subject like Dahmer.	0
What worried me about Clause 2 was that Santa Claus collides so hard with 21st century reality that it is disgusting.	0
It's an 88-minute highlight reel that's 86 minutes too long.	0
Film favours the scientific over the spectacular (visual).	0
Such an incomprehensible mess that it feels less like bad cinema than like a nightmare about bad cinema stuck in a dark pit.	0
With the exception of mccoist, the players have no clue about the park. Acting isn't much better.	0
The whole affair is as predictable as it gets.	0
a not so divine secret of the Ya-ya Sisterhood with a hefty portion of deep fried green tomatoes.	0

The Star Trek was once great, but today it is a copy of a copy.	0

The author's desperate attempt to develop wit is lost, leaving the character of the critical Jim two-dimensional and meaningless.	0

Although Disney follows its standard formula in this animated adventure, it feels more forced than usual.	0
Gaghan.   has thrown every thrilling cliché in the book at this nonsensical story.	0
A bogus construct based on theory, sleight of hand and bad hypotheses	0
[p] artnering murphy with robert de niro for the tv-cops comedy showtime seems to be a safe casting. The catch is that they are stuck with a script that prevents them from firing on all cylinders	0

Gooding offers a desperately unappealing performance.	0
Parker is to be commended for his fresh approach to familiar material, but his determination to remain true to the original text takes him to a slightly mannered tone.   , which ultimately blunts the human tragedy at the heart of the story.	0
The director filled the action with confidence at every turn. The results are far more disconcerting than they seem.	0
Bogdanich is unashamedly pro-Serbian and makes little attempt to give the other side a voice.	0

Bisset delivers a performance, but it can't save the film.	0

The most misanthropic major studio image in 3,000 miles to Graceland	0
The film can make you depressed about life itself.	0
I'm sure the filmmakers thought it was a remarkable and novel concept, but anyone who has ever seen an independent film can report that it's a cheap cliche instead.	0
the acting is fine, but the script is about as interesting as a recording of conversations at the Wal-Mart checkout.	0
The weighty themes are too serious for teenagers, but the story is too steeped in fairy tales and other childish things to appeal to teenagers.	0
The plot falls into a comedy graveyard before Jane rushes to the rescue in the final role.	0
Sometimes there are very, very good reasons for certain films to be sealed in a jar and left indefinitely on a distant shelf.	0
At 90 minutes, this film is short, but it feels much longer.	0
Here's my advice, kev. Read your scripts before signing this dashed line.	0
an alternately rough and juicy ethnic sitcom   You would be well advised to express your regret.	0
An ugly, horrible story told so abominably and clumsily feels random.	0
Unfortunately, it's not good either. especially compared to the television series that inspired the film.	0
It wraps a classic mother-daughter battle in recycled paper with a shiny new ribbon, and while the audience realizes it's not all new, at least it looks pretty.	0
Glazed with a tawdry B-movie scum.	0
This is the kind of film in which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you, on your cluelessness, on your idiocy, on your completely misplaced seriousness.	0
It moves in many directions, while looking (in vain, I think) for something fresh.	0
All in all, the path to ruin is the love of foreignness rather than excellence.	0
A big fat pain.	0
a mimetic approach to better films like Contempt and 8 1 / 2.	0
Incomprehensible, poorly played, insanely bad, the Harvest Man is ridiculous enough to become a cult classic.	0
Watching the Powerpuff Girls movie, one anecdote kept coming to mind: the cartoon in Japan that gave people fits.	0
A missed opportunity.	0
An inelegant combination of two incoherent short films, which lags far behind the director's previous work in terms of content and narrative.	0
Building a feel-good fantasy around a vain dictator-maniac is daunting to say the least, not to mention inappropriate and completely undeserved.	0
With the cheesiest monsters on either side of a horror parody that they are not, they are more likely to trigger sleep than fear.	0
Mild, meandering teen movie.	0
Although its atmosphere is fascinating.   The drama is too predictable to make much of an impression.	0
Although this crude and crude film does produce a few laughs, its digs at modern society are all we have seen.	0
Although it's trying to be much more, it's really just another big league.	0
Astonishingly, the word is not - nor is it incompetent, incoherent or simply crap. In fact, none of these words really gets close to the very special kind of viciousness that is Deuces Wild.	0
One thing is for sure: this film doesn't tell much about Lily chou-chou.	0
With a tone as variable as cinematography, Schäffer's film never lets itself get caught up in the light-footed enchantment that the material needs, and the quirks and pitfalls of the characters never spread charm.	0
To understand better why this has not been associated with me, I would have to look at it again and I will not sit through it.   That alone is enough.	0
Cuban gooding jr. He bravely fights his way through snow dogs, but even his boisterous energy fails to ignite this leaden comedy	0

Storytelling feels easy.	0
[He] falls victim to a sloppy plot, an offensively unbelievable final act and a villain too crazy to be interesting.	0
This remake of Linda Wertmuller's 1975 Eroti comedy could be the greatest married life in living memory.	0
Stupid, loud and stupid.	0
Why spend $9 on the same stuff you get for a dollar or so in that sleazy little vidgame pit in the theater lobby?	0

the pool drowned me in boredom.	0
It's like a star salute to Disney's cheesy commerce.	0
It is hard to imagine any current film, independent or otherwise, causing such chaos as this.	0
Some of the computer animation is good-looking, and various amusing sidekicks give the otherwise dark story a much-needed lightness, but overall the film never gets beyond mediocrity.	0
There is an excellent 90-minute film here, which unfortunately takes 170 minutes.	0
As with saccharin, it is likely to cause a massive cardiac arrest if taken in high doses.	0
Dying another day is only occasionally entertaining, but it's hard not to be excited by its charms, or perhaps it's just impossible not to feel nostalgia for movies you grew up with.	0

The conundrum is how to combine a rich historical theme with so much first-class talent.   could have produced such a flat, murky picture.	0
"It throws quirky characters, strange situations and oblique dialogue at us, as if to say: ""Look! It's an interesting film! ' But the film itself is ultimately pretty uninteresting."	0
The inherent limitations of using a video game as the source material for a movie become all too clear in this weird horror-action hybrid.	0

Avarys's film never emerges completely from the shadow of Ellis's book.	0
A poorly written, preachy fable that, in its eagerness to spread propaganda, forgets to tell a coherent, credible story.	0
While it is interesting to watch the conflict from the Palestinian side, Longley's film lacks balance.   and fails to place the struggle in a meaningful historical context.	0
"Woo has as much right to shoot a huge action sequence as any director, but how long will filmmakers copy the ""Saving Private Ryan"" battle scenes before they realize Steven Spielberg was right the first time?"	0
It's honest to a fault, but unfortunately not very convincing or funny.	0
Despite his distinctive screen presence, Jones is simply unable to muster a film that, despite its title, should have been much more vicious if he wanted to make full use of its leading lady's specific gifts.	0
This sequel seems so similar to the 1953 Disney classic that you long for a geriatric Peter.	0
Why, you may ask, should you buy the film Milk when the TV cow is free? there is no good answer.	0
This slow Swedish film doesn't even offer a hint of joy and focuses on the humiliation of Martin, who gets rid of himself in bed and urinates on the plants at his own birthday party.	0

The director occasionally pushes himself to the limit, but for most of the film it's hard to tell who's after whom or why.	0
There is nothing more frustrating for a film buff than seeing an otherwise good movie marred by a catastrophic ending until redemption.	0
It won't hurt anyone, but I can't think of a very good reason to rush off and see it. After all, it will probably be in video stores by Christmas, and it might just be better suited to a night in the living room than a night at the cinema.	0
looks more like a travel agency video aimed at people who like riding a topless bike and rolling in the mud than a worthwhile look at the lights of independent communities.	0
If you spend too much time looking at the looseness of the play, the picture begins to resemble the shapeless, gripping acting workshop it is.	0

Just because a walk is smart enough to activate girlish tear ducts doesn't mean it's good enough for our girls.	0
Carson's characters are both overblown and exaggerated, but subtlety has never been his trademark.	0
It is easy to ponder the peculiar American style of justice that is unfolding here, but it is so confused and derivative that few will bother to consider it.	0

hampered -- no, paralyzed -- by an indulgent script.   , which aims at poetry and sounds like satire.	0
Cheap, vulgar dialogue and a plot that creeps along at a snail's pace.	0
And if you appreciate the one-sided theme of Lawrenz's excessive tirade, then knock yourself out and enjoy the big-picture postcard that is a self-glorified love fest with Martin Lawrence. If you're ready for it, then crazy!	0

"It's a very tasteful rock ""n"" roll movie. You could put it anywhere on the coffee table."	0
The film is full of good intentions, but in its eagerness to squeeze the plot and our emotions into the all-too familiar dramatic arc of the Holocaust escape story, Minac draws on his individuality.	0
An angry movie. Just when you think you're making sense of it, something happens that tells you it makes no sense.	0
The whole film is so formulaic and unforgettable that it is barely over before it starts to fade from memory.	0
The scenery turns out to be more interesting than any of the character dramas, which never reach satisfactory conclusions.	0

It's not necessarily worth the money to spend the full price on a date, but when it comes out on video, it's worth the rent.	0
I can't begin to tell you how tiring, how decidedly unfunny, how thoroughly unrewarding it all is and what a reckless waste of four great acting talents.	0
everyone loves a david and goliath story, and it is told almost exclusively from david's perspective.	0
Get off the train!	0
Eventually they will have a test of strength, but until then your senses are as soggy as peas and you don't care who fires the winning shot.	0
irwin and his director never find a good reason why we should pay money for what we get for free on TV.	0
A light, gripping comedy that, with a crucial miscalculation in Act III, gambles away almost all of its accumulated pleasure.	0
Cedar wood defuses this provocative theme somewhat by immersing it in a grey love triangle.	0
To paraphrase a line from another Dickens novel, Nicholas Nickleby is too much like a fragment of an understated potato.	0
The actresses may have worked out a back story for the women they portray so convincingly, but viewers don't get enough of that backdrop for the characters to be involved as individuals, not types.	0
The result, however well-intentioned, is ironically exactly the kind of throwaway homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in Hollywood today.	0
An extremely unpleasant film.	0
A film only for Friday fans, critics be damned. If you like something like that, that's it.	0
a sincere but dramatically conflicted gay coming of age story.	0
Wait until it hits cable.	0
Ultimately, it feels like another film in the long line of films this year about filmmaking.	0
A high-minded snoozer.	0
Nothing but one relentlessly depressing situation after another throughout their entire lifespan, something to deal with right now in life.	0
77 minutes of Pokemon may not last forever, it just seems. My only wish is that the celebs take me back to a time before I saw this movie and I could just skip it.	0
The only not so small problem with the expectation is that the whole exercise has no real meaning.	0
a film to watch rather than one to enter.	0
Moore is a real charmer.	0
john carlen's script is full of unhappy, two-dimensional characters who are far from convincing.	0
The film's heroine can't avoid a fatal flaw in modernity: it has transformed the male academic from an underclass Brit to an American, a choice that upsets the novel's exquisite balance and shreds the film's substance.	0
The idea of erasing emotions from people is so insanely dysfunctional, even in an advanced process nation, that the wildly devised equilibrium becomes a concept for us.	0
Stale first act, Scrooge story, blatant product placement, some very good comedic songs, strong finish, silly farts.	0
Unsurprisingly, the way it all works makes women look more like stereotypical janitors and moral teachers than competitive athletes.	0
A film that loses sight of its own story.	0
The eight crazy nights of the ladies sandler come upon you like a rash.	0
the Scooby on the big screen makes the silly original cartoon seem clever and well made in comparison.	0
Few of the increasingly far-fetched events that first-time writer-director neil burger pursues are terribly convincing, which is a shame considering Barry's terrific performance.	0
will get better after the keeper leaves this small room.	0
The film is as padded as everyone's belly.	0
Domestic evil is less a product of its cinematic predecessors than an MTV, a sugar hysteria, and a playstation cocktail.	0
A rather average action movie that benefits from some funny moments that epps provides.	0
Unspeakable, unbearably boring, with innumerable flat-out dialogue and a heroine who seems both shallow and witless.	0
resembles a soft porn brian de palma pastiche.	0
bluto blutarsky, we miss you	0
harmless enough to make even Jean-claude van damme look good.	0
It's a glorified sitcom, and a long, unfunny one at that.	0
Woody Allen can write and deliver a one-line like anyone else. But I had a lot of problems with this movie.	0
Untenable.	0
It lacks all the qualities that made the first film special.	0
The seaside town fluctuates from one approach to the other throughout the film, but in the end it sticks to the formula -- which is a waste of de niro, mcdormand and the other good cast members.	0
The plotless collection of idiotic stunts is by far the worst film of the year.	0
As sincere as it may be, the ascent never fully justifies its own existence.	0
Parker updates the setting in an attempt to make the film relevant today, without fully understanding what made the story relevant in the first place.	0
It's a 21st-century morality game with a Latino hip-hop beat. But the second half of the film really goes downhill.	0
Paxton's uneven directorial debut fails to unleash the full potential of this genre, which is fresh and dramatically substantial in many ways.	0
The script becomes lifeless and crumbles like a cheap garden chair.	0
The script resorts to too many tried and tested tricks to distinguish it from the next teen comedy.	0
The film starts promisingly, but the ending is all too predictable and far too clichéd to work.	0
Let us put in place a moratorium, effective immediately, on animated films about inspirational preschool teachers and the children they so warmly encourage.	0
It is the element of condescension that makes sex with strangers, which opens today in the New York metropolitan area, so distasteful when the filmmakers look down from their lofty perch on their working-class subjects.	0
By turns frustrating and rewarding.	0
It is impossible to classify this as a dirty feeling of guilt.	0
Despite his humorous failure, the man who wrote Rock did not deserve to sink such a leaking ship.	0
Swinging, it seems in the film, is not a hobby that attracts young and fit people. Or smart.	0
The most memorable moment was when Green threw medical equipment at a window; not because it was particularly funny, but because I had a serious urge to grab the old lady at the end of the walkway and throw her on the screen in frustration.	0
See if you've got nothing better to do But be warned, you too may feel that time is running out. or that the battery of your watch is dead.	0
Too much familiarity has been lost as hip British filmmakers have mercilessly dismantled the Monty formula since 1997.	0
There are enough throwaway references to faith and rainbows to put smiling faces on that segment of the population that took a walk to remember a niche hit.	0
"Yes, I gave this film a zero rating. But fans of the show shouldn't consider this nonsense. Think of it as ""perfection."""	0
the cumulative effect of the film is repulsive and depressing	0
Children and adults who love Pokemon will not be disappointed.	0
I don't care that there's no plot in this Antonio Banderas-Lucy Lu faceoff. It's still terrible!	0
Though well dressed and well made, the children of the century end up falling prey to the contradiction that afflicts so many films about writers.	0
It's less a movie and more a joint advertisement for the National Basketball Association and teenage rap and teenage poster boy lil'bow wow.	0
Peralta's myth would have needed an informed, grown-up review.	0
Amazingly stupid.	0
A near-solid spy thriller with the misfortune of being published a few decades late.	0
disguises a familiar anti-feminist equation (career - children = misery) into annoying romantic-comedic duds.	0
The Good Girl is a film in which the talent is undeniable, but the results are below average.	0
Only a collection of this and that - whatever time fills - without a uniform whole.	0
The animation and gaming phenomenon, which peaked about three years ago, is actually dying a slow death, if the poor quality of Pokemon 4 is any indication.	0
Just about as sexy and dangerous as an actress in a role that recalls Elizabeth Berkley's flopping dolphin instinct at every opportunity.	0
Children who are interested in this thorny berry-like stuff will probably be in Wedgie heaven. Anyone else who, for any reason, is thinking of watching this film is hereby warned.	0
Judge! Soderbergh's direction and visual style struck me as unusual and unimpressively picky and demanding.	0
"Say ""hello"" to your loved one when you wake up in the morning?"	0
It makes me feel weird / when I think of all the bad things in the world / like puppies with broken legs / and butterflies dying / and movies with pop queen	0
Director Tom Dey showed in his charming debut in Shanghai in 2000 a knack for mixing action and idiosyncratic humor, but Showtime's uninspired distribution of TV cop show clichés usually leaves him empty handed.	0
Banal and predictable.	0
"""Yes, that's right: it's forest rubber, Death Angel."""	0
A wildly erratic drama with sequences that make one wince with embarrassment and others, thanks to the actors, that are very touching.	0
Though it's easier to prevail than most of Jaglom's confident and thankfully irritating films, it's still fraught with clichés, painful improbabilities and murky points.	0
I would imagine that finding a quarter in a huge pile of elephant droppings is about as pleasant as it gets.   Positively awful.	0
a generic international version of a typical American horror film	0
Though witty in some places, this too-long, nonsensical update of Shakespeare's Macbeth lacks inventiveness.	0
Critical indeed.	0
Lucas is actually closer to the cheap, graceful and hackneyed sci-fi series of the 30s and 40s than anyone could wish for.	0
There is a lot of good material here, but also a lot of redundancy and unsuccessful brutality.	0
Absurdities and clichés pile up like lint in the belly button of a fat man.	0
If you think it's a riot to see a young woman rob tailors, then you'll enjoy the hot chick.	0
The sheer stupidity of the plot (apart from its one good idea) and the inevitable whiff of sleaziness bring you down.	0
Strangely, a kingdom is milder than wild.	0
The next big thing is his less-than-big (and less-hot) directorial debut.	0
"Another repetition of what has become one of the film's scariest conventions, in which the developmentally handicapped are portrayed with almost supernatural powers to humiliate, teach, and ultimately save their mentally ""superior"" friends and family."	0
Bond inspired? Sure. Will it be a decade of classic movies? Let's hope not.	0
This flat run on a hip-hop tootsie is so slow you could put the whole pootie tang between the punchlines.	0
Davies has energy, but she doesn't bother to make her heroine's book sound convincing, the ideas of gender war original or the comic scenes fly.	0
Surprisingly, given that Baird is a former film editor, the film is quite abrupt.	0
None of this is particularly original or funny.	0
A bland murder on campus yawns.	0
A humourless journey into a philosophical void.	0
These two produce about as much chemistry as an Iraqi factory willing to get an inspector.	0
responsável direto pelo fracasso 'artístico' de doce lar, o roteirista c. jay cox não consegue sequer aproveitar os pouquíssimos momentos em que escapa da mediocridade.	0
Just as the lousy Tarantino imitations have faded, here comes the first lousy Guy Ritchie imitation	0
A passable romantic comedy that needs a few more runs through the word processing.	0
The film tries to elicit laughs from a genre - gangster / crime comedy - that didn't go down well with audiences a few years ago, and its cute dependence on movie-specific clichés isn't exactly endearing.	0
shows that Holmes has the screen presence to become one of the leading women in the major league, (but) the film itself is an underachiever, a psychological mystery that brings its sweet timeline to a climax that hardly comes as a surprise.	0
"On the book market, the film ""The Child Remains in the Picture"" would be an abridged edition"	0
Ultimately.   The film is too exhilarating for children and too preachy for adults.	0
It's just a bit too complacent.	0
Clever, but not particularly convincing.	0
mckay seems embarrassed by his own invention and tries to rush through the passages, apparently hoping that the audience will not notice the blatant banality of the instrument he uses.	0
A piece of mildly entertaining, harmless fluff that drifts aimlessly for 90 minutes before nestling into the cracks of this ever-growing category: unembarrassing but unmemorable.	0
Labute was more fun when his characters tortured each other psychologically and spoke publicly about their genitals.	0
The film weighs no more than a glass of champagne.	0
Brilliant hack.	0
the problem with antwone fisher is that it has a screenplay by antwone fisher based on the book of antwone fisher	0
Alarms for Duvall's throbbing sincerity and his old tendency to pat people on the back as they speak.	0
The maudlin way in which the story unfolds suggests a director who fights against the urge to sensationalise his subject matter.	0
What Rifkin's story of the precarious dignity of skidding achieves in grace is marginalized by predictable conspiracies and tedious historiography.	0
tries to function in the same way as the brilliance of Animal House, but instead approaches the failure of the third revenge of the nerds.	0
"Unfortunately, kapur modernizes one.   Mason's story, fitting the sensitivities of a young American, a decision that exposes ""the four feathers."	0
What a banal bore the preaching circuit is	0
Untruths are piling up, undermining the reality of the film and suppressing its creator's comic voice.	0
A mechanical action comedy whose ostensible purpose is to sell the charismatic Jackie Chan to an even younger audience.	0
one of the most contradictory features of recent history.	0
Low rent from frame one.	0
Eight-legged freaks? Not a big hairy affair.	0
The themes are presented so miserably, with some of the (unintentionally) funniest moments of the year, that you can't care.	0
The hesitant drama leans towards an uninspired philosophical revelation.	0
Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant's respective charms have worn off.	0
"""This film sucks."""	0
None of these so-called satires have a sting in the flesh, as if Woody is afraid to bite the hand that has finally warmed up somewhat.	0
bibbidy-bobbidi-fad.	0
Some non-believers may reconsider their attitudes when they see the joy the characters feel in this creed, but skeptics are unlikely to go to theater.	0
Bad in such a bizarre way that it is almost worth seeing, if only to witness the crazy interplay of sense and taste.	0
There's more repetition than creativity in the entire film.	0
Hugh Grant's act is so elaborate that it's sometimes hard to tell who the other actors in the film are.	0
Although the sequel has all the outer elements of the original, the sweet scaliness of the first film has disappeared and is replaced by the forced merriment found in the most boring children's films.	0
I had more interesting - and, dare I say, thematically more complex - bowel movements than this long-standing point-and-shoot exercise in a sophisticated thriller.	0
what we get.   is a caddy hack, which is crossed with the faithful order of raccoons.	0
The jokes are flat and the plot seems fake.	0
If a film asks you to take pity on Mick Jagger's sex life, you've already done it.	0
There are now two signs that this is happening. Shyamalan's debut feature absorbed everything he had to give to the mystical genres of cinema: unbreakable and characters.	0
The presumption of the hokey art house.	0
a weak and ineffective ghost story without conclusion or success.	0
We are littered with so many distracting special effects and visual party tricks that it's not clear whether to scream or laugh.	0
The picture seems defiant, poorly written, opaque and poorly staged, as if all who make it have lost their mojo.	0
This is a missed opportunity of gigantic proportions - a lunar mission without signs of life.	0
a mysterious subplot about drug smuggling inside Danish cows falls flat, and if you want to change the ending of the Bard, you better have a good alternative.	0
Soderbergh seems only capable of delivering artfully illuminated, serious research that lacks the kind of real depth that would save it.	0
The only thing that distinguishes a Randall-Wallace film from any other is the fact that there is no difference in a Randall-Wallace film.	0
Stupid stuff, all jumbled up like a semester work by a child who can't quite tell one science fiction work from another.	0
There is so much deceptive sensibility.	0
The city has a kind of authentic flair, but each of these people stands out and everyone else is in the background, and it just seems artificial to me.	0
too juicy for his own good.	0
Circuit queens won't learn anything, they'll be too busy cursing the film's strategically placed white sheets.	0
As an actress, Madonna is one of the helluva singers. When the Mediterranean sparkles, it sinks.	0
Again and again, a film comes along that is so insanely stupid, so terrible in so many ways, that you get dizzy. Half dead is such an achievement.	0
Extended to 65 minutes for theatrical release, it still feels somewhat unfinished.	0
It all looks like a $40 million version of a game you'd rather enjoy on a computer.	0
[javier bardem] is one of the few reasons to see the film, which director Gerardo Vera has impregnated with lively music and feverish melodrama.	0
feels shrill, simple and soapy.	0
adults, except parents.   will have a hard time heeding the call of the wilderness.	0
Brady manages the remarkable feat of squandering a first-class four.   by pushing them into every conceivable clichéd white trash situation.	0
In the name of a supposedly inspiring and easily marketable film, the Imperial Club turns a blind eye to the very history it claims to teach.	0
No amount of blood and crumbling vampire carcasses can mask the film's lack of ideas.	0
A release that goes straight to nowhere.	0
Typical anime with cheap animations (like Saturday morning television in the 1960s), a complex sword-and-witchcraft plot and characters with big round eyes and Japanese names.	0
Below expectations.	0
At no point during k-19: the widower felt enveloped by this viewer in a story that was supposed to be universal in its themes of loyalty, courage and devotion to a common goal, but never seems to leave the lot.	0
Standard guns versus martial arts clichés with little new.	0
The Empire cannot decide whether it wants to be a gangster movie or an art film. It doesn't work either.	0
Given that virtually no one has to go to the theatre for this, the project should have been made for the tube.	0
Possession is an honourable, interesting failure in the end. It lags far behind poetry, but it's not bad prose.	0
Jonathan Parker's Bartleby should have been the be-all and end-all of modern office anomie films.	0
"There may have been a good film in ""Trouble Every Day,"" but it's not what's on the screen."	0
Unfortunately, Carson's rubber-face routine is no match for the flimsy screenplay he devised with Harris Goldberg.	0
Viewed as comedy, romance, fairy tale or drama, this film is not nearly triumphant.	0
Given the stale plot and the pornographic way in which the film revels in maternity homes, dresses and parties, there's something unintentionally comic about the film.	0
"The master of disguise is funny - not ""ha ha"" funny, ""dead circus performer"" funny. And for the wrong reasons."	0
96 minutes of mediocre special effects, grey dialogue, flowing accents and - worst of all - silly looking morlocks.	0
A 75-minute rehearsal of childish rubbish, listless, witless and devoid of any sense of humour.	0
You leave the feeling of having undergone a long workout without your pulse ever racing.	0
The Waterloo script plumbs unexplored depths of stupidity, incoherence and subophomoric sexual banter	0
With mcconaughey in a completely irony-free zone and balls reduced mainly to twitching his sensitive eyelids, the screen lacks the intelligence, wit or innovation to attract and entertain older audiences.	0
It's the kind of stunt the Academy loves: a powerful political message stuffed into an otherwise mediocre film.	0
In theory, a middle-aged romance linking Clayburgh and Tambor sounds promising, but in practice it's something else entirely - clownesque and insulting and nothing like real life.	0
So numbingly awful, you'd hope Britney wouldn't do it again in terms of movies.	0
The images are usually shortened in favor of muddy matter-of-factness and telegraphed pathos, especially when it comes to Whitaker's inappropriate artists.	0
If Welles were unhappy at the prospect of humanity splitting in two, he probably wouldn't be too mad if his great-grandson's film split in much the same way.	0
sets animations back 30 years, musicals by 40 years and Judaism by 50 years.	0
Strangely, Besenfeld has compelling new material, but he only reveals it at the end, after endless scenes of torturing reluctant witnesses and pointing his camera through the smeared windshield of his rental car.	0
best as a day instructor.	0
comes to its core as a simple meditation on self reflection.	0
The film, which depicts both the scenic splendour of the mountains and the legendary actor Michel Serrault, is less successful on another level.	0
Boy, oh boy, it's a howl.	0
A few parts of the film whirr and whirr, very little of it clicks. It just doesn't get going.	0
contains hardly any laughs and even fewer surprises.	0
The actors must indeed be good at reciting some of these ridiculous dialogue with a straight face.	0
Most storylines feel like time-filler between surf shots. The film is not terrible, but you can see mediocre summits on the next wave.	0
Stale as the material may be, Lawrence's delivery remains perfect; his great gift is that he can actually make you think something of this worn, pandering palaver is funny.	0
There is nothing remotely current or sexy here.	0
"The tuxedo was not only bad, but, as my friend David Cross would call it, ""hungry servings bad."""	0
Blue Crush is so long and boring that it's not even close to the terribly bad film it promised.	0
The sequel plays like a flimsy excuse to give Blade fans another look at Wesley Snipe's iconic hero battling dozens of villains at once.	0
While Van Wilder may not be the worst national Lampoon film, he is far from the animal of this generation.	0
so devoid of lust and sensuality that one cannot even call it hedonistic.	0
It smacks of rotting and chopping from start to finish.	0
An exhausting family drama about a porcelain empire and as difficult as its content.	0
woody allen has really found his groove these days. The problem is that he can make one mediocre film after another.	0
the bland weighs more heavily than the fine, and cletis tout will never be the clever crime comedy it is.	0
It is such a mechanical undertaking that it never bothers to ask why anyone spends time on it.	0
The artistic direction is often exquisite and the anthropomorphic animal characters are beautifully rendered by clever make-up design, so one can hope that the later release on DVD will feature subtitles and the original Italian soundtrack.	0
If you like the predictability of bland comfort food, then the film is pleasant enough.	0
After all, in the history of the Academy, one might wonder what jazz was about in 2002. cellweger's tearful pout and spineless attempt at a genial role make her nomination for best actress even more interesting.	0
A really bad film with badly distorted logic by writer and director Kurt Wimmer.	0
a pleasant and engaging session, but when trying to have the best of both worlds, it falls behind.	0
Plot and animation offer daytime television, but little else.	0
is a tired, unimaginative and derivative variant of this already shallow genre.	0
In short, human nature is not nearly as funny as it thinks, and not nearly as intelligent.	0
A film with a great premise, but only one great premise.	0
Instead of becoming a laugh spasm, we are left with a handful of disparate funny moments with no real consequences.	0
Kirshner and Monroe seem to be in a contest about who can outwit the other. (Kirshner wins, but it's close.)	0
A lame romantic comedy about an unlikeable character and someone who probably wouldn't be so stupid as to get involved.	0
What started as a tight contest of wills between Bacon and Theron degenerates into a protracted and borderline stupid chase.	0
[Sam's] self-flagellation is depressing rather than entertaining.	0
An ugly, senseless, stupid film.	0
Simply put, there should have been a more convincing excuse to pair Susan Sarandon and Goldie Hawn.	0
The Master of Disguise is Adam Sandler's latest attempt to dumb down the universe.	0
This is a rude film, ill-fitting, with its elbows sticking out where knees should be.	0
Too stupid to take it seriously.	0
the inevitable double and triple crosses arise, but the only drama is waiting to hear the reedy consigliere of john malkovich utter his next line.	0
Everything is serious, poetic, serious and - unfortunately - boring.	0
I like it. No, I hate it. No, I love it.   I don't know.	0
This mess of a film is nothing less than a travesty of a transvestite comedy	0
It is full of heavy-handed symbolism, dime-store psychology and endless scenes that make 105 minutes seem twice as long.	0
Fifty car clichés.	0
It is a stale, over-used cocktail that has been using the same olives as a side dish since 1962. Race number 20 is not only the worst of the bunch, but also one of the worst of the series.	0
What ultimately makes Windtalkers a disappointment is the superficial way they handle their history.	0
As a showpiece, the war has much to recommend it, even if the best-paid Willis is not the most impressive. As a story of dramatic enlightenment, the screenplay by Billy Ray and Terry George leaves much to be desired.	0
A person who is not British could survive a screening without much harm, except perhaps for the last 15 minutes, which are as maudlin as you can imagine after school.	0
It's not hateful. It's just stupid, irrelevant and deeply, truly, bottomlessly cynical.	0
Perhaps not since grumpy old men have I heard a film so firmly tied to one demographic while arguing with another.	0
The drama was so uninspiring that even a story steeped in love, lust and sin could not capture my attention.	0
A rather tired nostalgic exercise.	0
The misery of these people becomes another voyeuristic spectacle to be consumed and forgotten.	0
Some bodies often look like an episode of the TV show's blind date, just less technically savvy and without the pop-up comments.	0
Bad Company has one of the stupidest scripts of the year, full of holes that are obvious even to those who don't seek them.	0
Predecessors stand next to the Scorpio King as intellectual masterpieces	0
The city is a decidedly inactive film, bordering on confessional.	0
While the children are likely to devour it, most adults are way ahead of the action.	0
One-sidedness.   flirts with propaganda.	0
Despite an impressive cast of stars and directed by Kathryn Bigelow, the weight of water is oppressively heavy.	0
We liked Klein's other work, but Rollerball left us cold.	0
They were afraid to show the film to critics before the opening, fearing the bad reviews they thought they deserved. They were right.	0
It would be petty to begrudge anyone any comfort they can find in Dragonfly, but it is impossible to find the film as anything other than appalling, shamelessly manipulative and constructed and utterly unconvincing.	0
offers no new insights into matter, nor do its characters come to life.	0
"nohe has made a decent ""intro"" documentary, but he feels like a spectator, not a participant."	0
It seems to be conceived as a reverie about remembrance and regret, but the only thing you will regret is remembering the experience, living it.	0
A 94-minute travesty of unprecedented proportions, writer-director Parker seems to be doing everything in his power to transform the classic false identity farce of the legendary joke into brutally edited and unfunny hocus pocus.	0
Guy becomes girl, guy loses girl, audience falls asleep	0
Too ordinary to bring [harmlessly] back to the fore, despite some creepy scenes that evoke childish nighttime horrors, and a commendable attempt to create tension rather than overwhelm the audience.	0
stirs potentially tantalizing ingredients into an uneasy mix of ghosts and close encounters of the third kind.	0
The strange thing about Clause 2, supposedly a children's film, is that it contains nothing that emotionally involves children.	0
It is arrogant in a way that borders on amateurism.	0
contains the humor, characterization, conciseness and intelligence of a bad sitcom	0
It doesn't matter that the film takes less than 90 minutes. It still feels like a prison run.	0
Part schmaltzy, part romantic comedy, part shallow reflection on the emptiness of success - and utterly soulless.	0
ong decides to portray Ahna's life as a light, weightless fairy tale, the most unpleasant details of which melt in the face of the character's sober optimism.	0
"The overall feeling is not like watching a glorious episode of ""7th heaven."""	0
Just a kiss is a waste.	0
This is not even a film we can enjoy as mild escapism; it is one in which fear and frustration are provoked to an intolerable degree.	0
Frankly, it's kind of insulting, both to men and women. And that's not so funny - which is just generally offensive.	0
As if that were not enough, this equally mocking clown is fixated on the spectacle of small-town competition.	0
A pitiful film that reduces the Second World War to the search for an old flame.	0
This is a remake of the numbers, combining a half-hearted plot with a series of standup routines in which Wilson and Murphy show how funny they could be in a more ambitious film.	0
it is better than the medium steven seagal, but not as sharp as jet li on roller blades.	0
No dia em que aceitou conductor esta continuação, harold ramis deve ter saído da cama com o pé esquerdo. e aqueles que decidiram assistir a este films também.	0
There is a reason why half-time is only 15 minutes long.	0
the talkative film plays like one of robert altman's smaller works	0
As jolly and vicious as his characters.	0
It was one of those films that started with a great premise and then just fell apart.	0
A pretentious mess.	0
"Nothing better or worse than ""truth or consequences, n.  or any other interchangeable action is fraudulent mafia tool bags botching a routine task in a Western backwater."	0
A sour attempt to give the female set a whimsical, down-to-earth laugh.	0
[Macdowell] ventures beyond her abilities several times and shows how bad an actress she is.	0
i can imagine this film as a b & w british comedy, around 1960, with Peter Sellers, Kenneth Williams and others. , but at this point this film with this cast is hopeless.	0
Chatty, artificial and opaque.   An interesting technical exercise, but a laborious picture.	0
Kurys never shows why Sand and Musset deserve special attention out of all the fleeting romantic lives of the time.	0
Almost nothing else - however impetuous and vivid it may be in the presentation - is one-sided, outwardly sexist or mean. And in a way, it's a burden.	0
It's easy to love Robin Tunney - she's pretty and she can act - but it's getting harder and harder to understand her choices.	0
If you have a house full of tots - don't worry, it will be on video long before they grow up and you can wait until then.	0
"the new film by anton chekhov's the cherry obstard puts the ""ick"" in ""classic."""	0
has a lively musical beat to which you can dance, but its energy cannot be compared to the wit, humour and snappy dialogue of the original. If I want music, I buy the soundtrack. If I want a real movie, I buy the Criterion DVD.	0
An unobtrusive, modern action / comedy buddy film, the only nostalgic note of which is in the title.	0
has all the right elements, but completely fails to fit together.	0
"Screenwriter and director Steven Gaghan has made the near fatal mistake of being what the English call ""half too clever."""	0
Seagal ran out of movies years ago and that's just proof.	0
The film is constructed in such a way, nonsensical and formulaic, that the ancient shelf, if one imagines it, would be a better place to store it.	0
an embarrassingly garish showcase that deviates from anything that even remotely probes or penetrates.	0
The name is program. jackass is a vulgar and cheap-looking version of the honest camera that was staged for the Marquis de sade set.	0
Children, Christian or not, deserve to hear the full story of Jonah's despair - in all its agonising, bewildering glory - even if they spend years trying to understand it.	0
Pleasant, but no more than a recycled jockline.	0
The kind of film you see because the theatre has air conditioning.	0
"Who needs enemies in Zoe Clarke-Williams's lacklustre thriller ""new best friend""? Just another generic drama that has nothing to offer but its exploitative palette of obligatory cheap thrills."	0
Hip-hop prison thriller of startling absurdity.	0
is an uneven mix of dark satire and childhood awakening.	0

"The film would have been more enjoyable if the balance had shifted in favor of a water-bound plot over the land-based ""drama,"" but the emphasis on the latter leaves a water jam."	0

Like a soft drink that sits open too long: it's too much syrup and not enough fat.	0
As the film dragged on, I thought I had heard a mysterious voice and felt powerfully drawn to the light - the light of the exit sign. I have come back from the hereafter to warn you: this film is 90 minutes long and life is too short.	0
There are some rather disturbing scenes, but they never really manage to shock the viewer.	0
The Emperor's Club is one of those films that have all the good intentions in the world.	0
In the end, the weight of water resembles the kind of soft-core chirping you would expect from Showtime's Red Shoe Diaries.	0

The re-enactments, fascinating as they are as a story, are too crude to serve the work particularly.	0
For a film about one of cinema's giants, it lacks brilliance.	0

Too clever to ignore, but a little too smug to like, this could be a film that slaps its target audience in the face by shooting itself.	0
A well made but emotionally distracted film, whose hero only gives his heart to the dog.	0
The most obnoxious adaptation of a classic text since Roland Joffé and Demi Moore's The Scarlet Letter	0
the occasional moments of creative madness get lost in the thin soup of humour.	0
As a film, it never seems fresh and vital. It never plays so dramatically, even when dramatic things happen to people. It struggles as a narrative.	0
the adventures of Pluto-Nash are quite a lot Nada.	0
A really good premise is lost in the middle of the street.	0
The lawyer should stick to his job. He's a better actor than a stand-up comedian.	0
Although this movie wasn't as bad as I thought, it's still not a good movie	0
A well-made indie flick that needs a few tricks and more chemistry between its stars.	0
I never thought I'd say that, but I'd much rather watch teenagers stick their genitals in fruit cake!	0
A film that is neither bitter nor sweet, neither romantic nor comedic, neither warm nor blurred.	0
Tiresomely derivative and hammering.	0

is as erratic as its central figure.	0
"Whatever the satirical lucky guy's aspirations, he certainly strayed into the ""soon to be unforgettable"" part of the quirky rip-off. It's this petty theft that puts such flimsy films behind bars"	0
The package in which this fascinating - and timely - content is wrapped is disappointingly general.	0
Guys say mean things and shoot a lot of bullets. Some of the characters die and some don't, and the film pretends that the living have learned some lesson, and no one in the audience really cares.	0
wildly incompetent, but brilliantly half-dead - or for seagull pessimists: completely outdated.	0
Just another combination of bad animation and senseless violence.   There is not even a hint of wit or charm.	0
The whole narrative gymnastics of the film cannot hide the fact that it is inauthentic at its core and that its story is simply not worth telling.	0
Similar to the slightly disapproving attitude towards the upscale lifestyle, there is not much here.	0
Ultimately, the film offers no more than people in an urban jungle who need others to survive.	0
For all its shootings, fist fights and car chases, this film is a phlegmatic bore, so tiring that it's the silly spy vs. In the spy movie, the sum of all fears with Ben Affleck in the lead role seems almost hitchhiking.	0
This gentle farce directed by one of its writers, john c. Walsh, is cheesy in a way that suggests an expiration date long ago.	0

meyjes concentrates too much on Max, when he is supposed to fill the canvas with this tortured, boring artist and monster in making.	0
Jakobi, the most fluent of all actors, gets relatively dry material from Nijinsky's writings to perform, and the visuals, even the erotically open ones, become boring.	0
Crudup's screen presence is the one thing that interests amid a soggy, existential exploration of why men leave families.	0

An incredibly thin joke aimed at the tiniest segment of an already obscure population.	0
The only thing I laughed at was the people who paid for it.	0
All the elements are there for a great film noir, but director George Hickenlooper's approach is too optimistic.	0

The phone rings and a voice tells you you have seven days to live Then you get another call warning you that you could face daunting charges if the video doesn't appear on Blockbuster before midnight.   , not really.	0
Perhaps the most irresponsible image ever released by a major film studio.	0

The film would seem less banal if it were. sugarman continued her resistance to the saccharin.	0
It's just not very smart.	0
Like the agonizing ending of days, Schwarzenegger presents himself as a tragic figure, but compassion really belongs to every viewer forced to watch him try out so many complicated facial expressions.	0
Imagine (if possible) a Pasolini film without passion or politics, or an Almodovar film without beauty or humour, and you have an idea of the boring, deaf experience, o fantasma.	0
When he tries to be bold and original, he only occasionally seems satirical and never fresh.	0
90 minutes of punishing with eardrum cubes, screeching metal shards and limp snipers.	0
Although many of the actors generate a spark or two in their first appearance, in this cold vacuum of comedy, they can't generate enough heat to generate a reaction.	0

This story has been told and retold; the races and thugs change, but the song remains the same.	0
A surprisingly flat retread, hampered by half-baked setups and sluggish pace.	0
Forget the psychological study of romantic obsession 101 and just watch the costume procession in castles, and it won't seem so boring.	0
a film that should be relegated to a dark corner of the video store somehow finds its way into cinemas. It's hard to imagine the acting being flatter.	0
To describe exactly how bad it is, new ways of describing wickedness must be developed.	0
Much effort and intelligence are shown, but in execution everything is clumsy, static and lifeless.	0

Despite all the violence, the film is remarkably dull, only cocaine makes an impression.	0

It's that rare combination of bad writing, bad direction and bad acting - the trifecta of evil.	0
Every scene is full of routine, the film never manages to create a single tension.	0

Bristle Child represents the worst kind of filmmaking, the kind that pretends to be passionate and truthful but is really frustratingly timid and muddy.	0
The lack of personality permeates all aspects of the film, from the TV-like depiction of children to the most boring Irish pub scenes ever filmed.	0
works at the level of the Whoodunit, while its larger themes disappear in the shadow of itself	0
This could be the worst film a man has made about women since The Valley of Dolls.	0
4ever has the same appeal as Pokemon videos, but breathes more on the big screen and causes slower headaches.	0

The filmmakers lack nerve.   to fully exploit the script's potential for sick humour.	0
The film wasn't a sermon, but it was feminism after the book.	0

If you resurrect a dead person, the paper version should get a blow, right?	0
Cattaneo should have followed the resounding success of his first film, Full Monty, with something else.	0
The film is formulaic, its plot and pace typical of Hollywood war films, while the performances evoke a sense of déjà vu rather than awe	0

Lord. Actions is less a film than a loose collection of less funny gags, isolated moments of lazy humour.	0
How he escaped the lifelong network I will never know.	0
Couldn't someone rob a tailor and swap him for a funny person?	0
Hollywood will have an original idea for a teen movie these days, but until then, there's always this rehash for younger generations.	0

I must admit I'm baffled by Jason x.	0
A mean film by someone who may have read the Catcher in the Rye but is clearly suffering from dyslexia	0

Cox is much more preoccupied with the exaggerated madness, not the man, and the results could drive you crazy.	0
to be influenced mainly by the greatest shame of humanity, reality shows -- reality shows for God's sake! - is a crime that should be punished with a chainsaw.	0
Overall, the tuxedo doesn't make much.	0

A frustrating tweener - too slick, invented and exploitative for the art houses and too cynical, small and decadent for the malls.	0
The surprise of this traditional thriller, which is moderately successful but not entirely satisfactory, is how gentle and unsurprising the execution is.	0
Drowning is too good for this sucker.	0
An unforgettable snow and stunt extravaganza, probably topped by an avalanche of more attractive products for the holiday season.	0

My precious new Star Wars film is a clumsy, chattering tug.	0
The innocence of the holiday cheer is no longer what it once was.	0
Too bland to work as direct drama, and too violent and dirty to work as comedy, is vulgar, truly, and thank God, unique.	0
A terrible little propaganda film with fascinating connections not only to the Serbs themselves, but also to a network of American right-wing extremists.	0

A boring pretentious mess that uses a sensational, real-life 19th-century crime as a metaphor for - well, I don't know exactly what - and has the dramatic weight of a raindrop.	0
Sheridan had a wonderful account from which to work, but strangely he diluted it by turning sand and vulnerability into light reading.	0
Heavy with flaccid rollers typical of trawling.	0
It's very difficult to take care of the character, and that's the central flaw of the film.	0
Snow dogs find their humour in a black man who is humiliated by a pack of dogs smarter than him	0
Entire sections of the film are incomprehensible to moviegoers who are not dressed in plain black.	0

It's sad that we can't have a happy ending to the life of Heather.	0
In the end, there's no more than the latest Schwarzenegger or Stallone.	0
The film argues strongly about the social status of America's indigenous peoples, but in reality it exists only to trigger an emotional tug of the heart that it does not get.	0

If the tuxedo was actually a suit, it would fit in the basement like a $99 bargain.	0
Parents beware, this is downright film penance.	0
a complete mess of such a sloppy, so uneven, so damn unpleasant film that I can't believe any viewer, young or old, would have a good time.	0
has nothing good to say except that it is relatively short, trying its best to hide the fact that Seagal is overweight and out of shape.	0
a pathetically nonsensical and unimaginative cross between xxx and vertical border.	0
Impeccably filmed, sexually charged, but ultimately devoid of substance, not to mention a leaden final act.	0
sometimes feels like a huge commercial for universal studios, where much of the action takes place.	0
While the puzzle is solved, the figures react by hitting each other.	0
Britney Spears' falsehood is nothing compared to the elaborate, lame script and listless direction.	0
Any sequel you skip will take two hours. Consider this review life-affirming.	0
If the film was just comedy, it might work better. But she has the ambition to say something about her subjects, but no willingness.	0
The film feels beautiful, but exhausting, with a touch of writing practice.	0
Twenty-three films into a great directorial career, Clint Eastwood's efficiently minimalist style has finally abandoned him. Big time.	0
This robbery of young Brooklyn hoods has gone off the shelves after two years to capitalize on the popularity of Vin Diesel, Seth Green and Barry Pepper It should have stayed there.	0
The film has a childlike quality. But the feelings the film evokes are lukewarm and quickly over.	0
The most opaque, smug, and just plain stupid excuse for a movie, as you can imagine.	0
It's not a film to be taken literally on any level, but its focus always seems questionable.	0
The Big Fat Liar is little more than the house itself, which has been raised to a new, self-deprecating level.	0
The film is magnificently made, but also a little shallow and artful.	0
The only time 8 crazy nights come close to hitting a comedic or satirical target is during the weird music numbers.	0

There's a wonderfully quirky film that can be made from curling, but brooms can't.	0
History suffers from a serious case of simplicity, superficiality and silliness.	0

well-intentioned but not original.	0
"The experience of most abused women is about as similar to Spider-Man's as most teenagers ""experiences."	0
Towards the end of all fears, the film turns into a banal disaster movie of the 1970s.	0
Director Charles Franklin, so crisp and economical in one wrong move, lapses into genre clichés here.	0

It's just rubbish.	0
How the neighbor's dog is killed is easy but unbearable.	0
There must be an audience enjoying the Friday series, but I wouldn't be interested in knowing any of them personally.	0

An empty exercise, a flowery but ultimately vague crime melodrama with plenty of surface flash but little emotional resonance.	0
if you are curious to see the darker side of what is going on with young TV actors (Dawson Leery did what?   , or some interesting storytellers, you might want to try it out, but there is nothing very attractive about this film.	0
My own minority report is that it stinks.	0

If, like me, you find an action film disguised as a war anthem initially repellent, then you face a painful journey.	0
While solondz strives and strives, storytelling offers little more insight than the inner column of a torn book cover.	0
with very little to add, apart from the dark visions already conveyed by outstanding younger predecessors such as swimming with sharks and the player, this latest spit.   Insiders and outsiders alike could be deterred.	0

What remains is a variation on the good-natured 19th-century figure, here a more angry if less angry version of the irresponsible Sandlerian undermined by the voice of the road-trip star.	0

She has the strength, but not the brains.	0
Mindless and boring martial arts and rampages with too little excitement and zero convincing plot.	0
A lot of talent is wasted in this crass, under-performing operation.	0
Showing these characters in the plot and not giving them any feelings of remorse - and repeatedly reducing them to the flashback of the original rape - is highly exaggerated.	0
[t] oo many of these crass scenes.	0

Little is done to support the premise, except to back it up with gags to see which ones cut it.	0
Reno does what he can in a thankless situation, the film veers from humor to violence and back again, and ryoko hirosue makes us wonder if she's always like that.	0
If Jews were Catholics, the Catechism would be	0
One of those movies that seems tailored to pay-TV to offer a few humble pleasures when you have nothing else to watch.	0
The big final surprise almost saves the movie. What a pity the rest is not more compelling.	0
Charming, if too complicated.	0
Schneider's raids are relentless, and his constant need to suddenly change into another character undermines the continuity and progress of history.	0
All very stylish and beautifully photographed, but much more effort than it is worth, with fantasy mixed with reality and actors playing more than one role, just to add to the confusion.	0
It's probably not easy to make such a worthless film.	0
There is always hope that the film will live up to the apparent abilities of its makers and the talents of its actors, but it does not.	0

For a man who has waited three years with breathless anticipation for a new film to hit him, this is no great loss.	0
slips away from the manufacturer constantly.	0
suffocated by its own solemnity.	0
"""Christian Bale's Quinn [is] a leather-clad grunge pirate with a wind tunnel-like hairstyle and a simply amazing Cor-Blimey-Luv-a-Duck Cockney accent."	0

Not a single moment in the company has not led me to lie down in a dark room with something cool on my head.	0
In the era of the sopranos, it feels painfully redundant and fake.	0
The mood is altogether strained and complacent, like a spring-break orgy for demanding majors.	0
Breen's script is sketchy, with actorial notations on the edge of the play.	0
There is no question that Epps hits once or twice, but it is significant that his funniest moment comes when he falls about ten metres on his head.	0
if only the dealer would pay more attention to history.	0
At the hour mark, she simply runs out of ideas, and the pace becomes positively leaden as the film reaches its inevitable tragic end.	0
too contrived to be as naturally charming as it needs to be	0
A simpler, slimmer treatment would have been better; after all, it is sometimes funnier to go for nothing than something.	0
The characters are based on clichés, and the attempt to complicate the story lacks credibility.	0
From the bland songs to the colourful but flat drawings, everything is well and quickly forgotten.	0

A domestic melodrama with weak dialogue and biopic clichés	0

plays like a cheesy TV production from a bygone era	0
The end result is like cold porridge with only one or two pleasantly tough lumps.	0

Naive fans might be disappointed. Those who do not know the work of the author, however, can quickly fall asleep.	0
Hoffman waits too long to turn his film in an unexpected direction, and even then his tone retains a posh prep school quality that feels dusty and leather-bound.	0
"If you're a crocodile hunter, you'll at least enjoy the ""real"" parts. If you're looking for a story, don't worry."	0
The full frontal effect had no effect and elicited no sympathy from either character. So it's a failure.	0
is an amazing mixture of gritty realism and magical realism with a difficult to swallow premise.	0
An affable but malnourished romantic comedy that can't keep up with the freshness of the earlier collaboration between actress, producer and writer lacks genius.	0
Sometimes that modest number clicks, sometimes not.	0
like a pack of dynamite rods, built for controversy. The film is explosive, but some of these sticks are wet.	0
has its charming quirks and its dreary spots.	0
Evans, a self-confessed egomaniac, is no Hollywood villain, yet you almost wish he'd gone the way of Don Simpson in that grille.	0
The audience, when I saw it, laughed at the wrong time, and that's a bad sign when they're supposed to have a collective heart attack.	0
Everybody is to blame.	0
One gets the impression that writer and director Burr knows the territory.   But his sense of humour has not lost the smug complacency that is normally associated with better private schools.	0
less a study of madness or love than a study of schoolgirl delusion.	0
Rice never clearly defines his characters and gives us no reason to care about them.	0
It is a bizarre curiosity, which is especially memorable because it gambles away its potentially interesting material with a banal script, unspectacular acting and indifferent direction.	0
An easy and obvious effort, even for a target group whose demographic development is probably still in the single digits.	0
Sex with strangers will shock many with its blunt candour. But what is missing is morality. What are the filmmakers concerned about? Why did they feel it necessary to document all this emotional misery?	0
You see Robin Williams and psycho killers and you think, hmmm. You see the film and you think zzzzzzzzz.	0
"The script's endless attack on embarrassingly shameless sex jokes, which smell like a recast designed to give the film a ""cooler"" rating, is pretty transparent."	0
The film slips as macho action conventions prevail.	0
Formulas of 51. Power, rather like this.	0
Dragqueen 'on Dragons	0
"Howard and his co-stars all give engaging performances, but they are often thwarted by Howard's confident attempts to find a ""literary"" film style that suits his theme."	0
A respectable but uninspired thriller, intelligent and thoughtful in its details, but ultimately weak in its impact.	0
Jones helps to breathe some life into the insubstantial plot, but even he is overwhelmed by predictability.	0
The film has just too much on its plate to really stay afloat during its 90-minute running time.	0
comes across more as a crime, a flat, unconvincing drama that never catches fire.	0
Film ready.	0
offers absolutely nothing I have not seen before.	0
"""Analyze that"" is one of those crass, invented sequels that not only fails itself, but also suggests affection for the original."	0
You could say that Tykwer did everything heaven allows, if you wanted to make an anti-kieeslowski pun. It is only fair to say that its overall promise remains somewhat unfulfilled.	0
complex, tortuous and somehow repulsively cold	0
First-time writer and director Dylan Kidd also has a good ear for dialogue, and the characters sound like real people.	0
An airless, pre-packaged Julia's would-be robber, who stinks so badly of hard image editing that you wonder if Lopez's publicist should write the script.	0
Gold member has none of the visual wit of previous images, and it looks like Jay cockroach steered the film from behind a taxi.	0
"You might as well have said ""under siege 3: at Alcatraz.""   A cinematic corpse that never comes to life."	0
Compared to his earlier films, despite the title, it seems like a disappointingly thin slice of London underclass life.   is surprisingly little.	0
lame sweet home leaves no stereotype of the South untouched.	0
Slow, dry, poorly cast, but beautifully shot.	0
The jokes are secondary, stereotypes are spread everywhere and the acting ranges from bad to physical.	0
will offer many ministers and Bible study groups hours of material for discussion. But mainstream audiences will find little interest in this film, which is often preachy and poorly acted.	0
In his heart of hearts, the rush is so great that he ignores the very problems he raises.	0
This long and relentlessly sacharistic film is a clear case of preaching to converts.	0
The film is flat.	0
But the film is a bumpy ride.   It is at least observable.	0
"It's a boom box of a film that could be called ""The Loud and the ridiculous.""   the pandering to a cinema audience dominated by young men is too calculated."	0
An incredibly stupid film, but occasionally funny enough to make you forget its absurdity.	0
The first deadly attraction was vile enough. Do we really need the Tiger Beat version?	0
This Bond film goes off the beaten track, not necessarily for the better	0
The problem is that the film has no idea whether it's serious or not.	0
When the fire burns out, we are dealing with only a few dragons, and this is where the film ultimately fails.	0
It would work much better than an hour-long TV documentary.	0
The elements were all there, but the lack of a pyschological centre flattens them out.	0
Anaemic chronicle of the money that robs New York and its loveless connections.	0
It just doesn't have enough weight to justify its two-hour playing time.	0
an unsuccessful attempt at an idea film.	0
Queen of the Damned, as you might have guessed, unfortunately uses aaliyah in her only starring role - she does little here but point to things that go up in flames.	0
This toothless dog, already sitting on the cable, loses every bite on the big screen.	0
It made me feel impure, and I'm the guy who liked that there was something about Mary and the two American pie movies. Oh, and spoil reputation.	0
Not only is it crazy, manipulative, and as bland as a miracle bread dipped in milk, it does the very last thing Hollywood needs to do to us: preach.	0
It is so crammed with scenes and perspectives and beautiful moments that a few crucial things, such as character development and cohesion, are left out.	0
An eviction order should be issued in any theatre serving sara.	0
Director Rob Mitchell gets so many of the little things right that it's hard not to punish him harshly for botching the big things.	0
"A loud, cheap and tired formula film, which appears in the euphemism ""urban drama."""	0
The film has a wooden script (by Paul Pender) and is mercilessly folksy, a procession of staged set pieces stacked with binary opposition.	0
A pathetic exploitative film that tries to appear sincere and just seems worse for wear.	0
Eventually, all this visual trickery ceases to be clever, and lapses into flashy, vaguely silly overkill.	0
Despite its charm and heart, this quirky football import is memorable	0
"Meyjes ""film doesn't work any more than Max Rothman's future."	0
What is so desperately needed, but practically lacking here, is either a saving dark humour or a sense of poetic tragedy.	0
Master tailor.   makin 'a fool of himself.   loses its fan base.	0
An ambitious, serious film that manages to do virtually everything wrong; it's something of an act of cinematic penance.	0
Not even remotely exciting.	0
Bartleby is not particularly good at any of these things, a Frankenstein mish-mash that ranges from dark satire to graphic slapstick	0
It plays like an after-school high-budget special with a generous cast that sometimes liberates the subject from its well-meaning awkwardness.	0
The quiet American has something not entirely convincing. and that goes for both the film and the title character, played by Brandan Fraser.	0
One of those strained caper films that is hardly fun and begins to evaporate from memory minutes after its end.	0
Needed a little less bling and more romance.	0
The end is not working.   But most of the film works so well that I almost recommend it anyway -- maybe not to everyone, but definitely to people who are curious about how a movie can go very well and go wrong.	0
It's hard to believe these pranksters have carried out four similar kidnappings.	0
I'm not quite sure what this film is about.	0
He is an uncomfortably shallow and immature character, which gives him 110 claustrophobic minutes to live.	0
The pace is so high that none of the outstanding performers can breathe.	0
The bottom line, at least in my opinion, is that Hoax is a better short story than a movie.	0
Some elements of it really blow to the big beat, but other parts are neat.	0
It's just a shame that the story of the film doesn't live up to its style.	0
"If you are not a fanatic, the best advice is: ""Scooby"" not."	0
a cautionary tale about the folly of superficiality, which is itself endlessly superficial	0
For single digit nidlets, the small 2 is still a breeze. If you want to rekindle the magic of the first film, you need a stronger stomach than we do.	0
Shreve's graceful dual narrative is clunky on screen, and we are repeatedly torn between a compelling historical story and a less convincing soap opera.	0
contains a few big laughs, but many more that graze the funny bone or miss it altogether, partly because the deliberately dumb approach is thin.	0
Nothing more than a widget cranking up the assembly line to see if stupid Americans can get rid of stupid Brits with sweet accents, ancient slapstick and silly tricks.	0
This is a film tailored to those who, when they were in high school, preferred cliff-edge scores to reading a long classic.	0
The film is undone by a method of filmmaking that is experimental enough to alienate mainstream audiences, while being clichéd to die-hard indie minds.	0
A tangled fantasy comedy that didn't find a coherent game plan in script, filming or post-production.	0
A sad and audacious exercise in milking a bogus idea - a heterogeneous guy has to dress in drag - that shockingly is even worse than its title suggests.	0
The personal speed was supposed to explore the inner workings of these women, but it never moves beyond its surface.	0
We hate [Madonna] for the first five minutes of the film, and she lacks the skill or presence to make up ground.	0
[ahola] sounds like arnold schwarzenegger, with a physique that matches that, has a wooden delivery and encounters a considerable arc of change that does not produce any real transformation.	0
Two big things are missing - anything approaching a visceral kick, and anything with even a vague reason to sit it out.	0
A fascinating but blunt documentary.	0
Hardly worth mentioning, apart from the fact that there are reports of weeds blowing through the empty rooms.	0
The foofus-on-the-loose welcome chatter towards Collinwood has a swagger. And, as with most late-night bull sessions, the content is not nearly as compelling as the participants think.	0
Too staged, too talkative - and too long - for its own good.	0
apparently from the editing room of any day soap.	0
The dark inspiration that fueled Devito's early work is confused in death with something ugly and spiritual.	0
Despite Auteuil's performance, it's a rather listless walk in the middle of the street, where the thematic irony is too obvious and the sexual politics too smug.	0
Director Boris von Sikowski opts instead for a routine slasher film that was probably more fun than sitting through.	0
Little more than a well-acted TV melodrama shot for the big screen.	0
never come together into a coherent whole.	0
an unintentionally surreal image of children.   , in which actors in bad bear suits perform a kind of cross-species parody of a Vh1 behind the music sequence.	0
First, a film that tries to be smart is somehow stupid. And second, what about all the shooting?	0
They don't even bother to rent it on video.	0
I guess there's something frontal about stunts and acting and how it distorts reality for people who make movies and watch them, but like most movie puzzles, it only works if you're interested in the characters you see.	0
This is the kind of film that gets a quick release before real contenders arrive in September.	0
Quite apart from a few crass comedies I try to forget, this is the first film in a long time that caused me to close the theatre in the first 10 minutes.	0
plays like a long, meandering sketch, inspired by the works of john waters and todd solondz, rather than a fully developed story.	0
The film lacks enough innovation or pizzazz to attract teenagers, and lacks the novel charm that made Spy Kids a surprise winner among both adults and younger viewers.	0
A quirky self-parody set like a strange masterpiece theatre sketch, without a standpoint or compelling reason.	0
An average B-movie without ambition to be more.	0
Barlett's hero remains a reactive cipher, if opening the man's head and heart is the only conceivable reason for the film.	0
Gibney and Jarecki just want to tie up the bastard.	0
The plot is plastered with one Hollywood cliché after another, most of it about precocious children gaining the upper hand over obnoxious adults.	0
Less worry about all the drama in Frida's life and more time spent exploring her process of turning pain into art would have made this film superior.	0
A film that suffers from its many excesses.	0
Too bland and tasteless to be really prudish.	0
In any case, I would only recommend big bad love to wingers who have been missing since 1995. But even then I would recommend to wait for the DVD and jump directly to its scenes.	0
shows the saddest and dirtiest human behaviour on screen and then laughs at how clever it is.	0
"Nijinsky says, ""I know how to suffer,"" and when you see this film, you know it."	0
'cq may one day be remembered as the brief pretentious phase of the Coppola novel, before moving on to other films that tell a story worth considering	0
The only thing scary about this film is that the filmmakers and the studio are brazen enough to portray it as a scary movie.	0
Stale and uninspired.	0
A bleak film.	0
The story just goes on, in search of astute observations, and goes on empty.	0
"Instead of inventing the death of a climate hero for the beloved main character, who will remain nameless, why not invite a real spontaneity to the film by actually letting the evil aliens ""laser guns hit?"	0
It just didn't mean much to me and was too distorted to ever get a grip on (or entertain).	0
This action thriller / dark comedy is one of the most repellent things to emerge in a movie year already littered with celluloid rubbish.	0
mib ii is a film that allows the viewer to fall asleep for a few minutes or make several runs to the stand and / or the toilet and not feel as if he has missed something. This is because relatively nothing happens.	0
"no amount of art theory - the special effects are ""German Expressionist,"" according to the press release - can make this anything but ridiculous."	0
Blue Crush follows the formula, but throws in too many conflicts to make the story compelling.	0
Boyd's screenplay (co-written with Guardian hack Nick Davies) has a flourishing twist that owes more to Guy Ritchie than the Bard.	0
There is no spark of new inspiration in it, just more of it, with much less energy and imagination.	0
Jackson strolls through the mess with a smug grin, inexplicably wearing a kilt and a bag of golf clubs over one shoulder.	0
a moving image that does not move.	0
Quiet-raw! Nothing is really right with this crack!	0
Its central points are simultaneously buried, drowned and suffocated in the excesses of writer-director Roger Avary.	0
I'm not sure these words have ever been summed up in one sentence: this erotic cannibalism is boring.	0
"""God help us, but Capra and Coopers roll in their graves."""	0
An hour and a half of harmless, unmemorable filler.	0
Is it a comedy? A drama? A romance? A caricature?	0
If the film starts off so funny, it's nothing.	0
Did the film inform and clarify me? Yes. Was it interested in what happened in Armenia in 1915? No. And here Araat was wrong.	0
It's a bad sign in a thriller when you know someone instantly.	0
has its usual jovial atmosphere, but a lack of specious inventiveness.	0
Eight-legged freaks won't be joining the pantheon of the big monster / science fiction movies we love.	0
It gets the details of its time frame right, but it completely misses its emotions.	0
Who is actually fighting whom? Yes, that would be me: fighting the urge to doze.	0
A kilted jackson is a disturbing sight and indicative of his, if you like, off-kilter character wandering aimlessly through ill-conceived action pieces.	0
The film is elaborate, clumsy and full of unintentional laughs, and shows signs that someone other than the director came into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the film faster.	0
begins with enormous promise and introduces a fascinating and seductive premise, only to fall victim to a shipload of script clichés that sink it faster than a leaking freighter.	0
The film too often lapses into sugar-sweet sentiments and holds the pyrotechnics, which it promises in its punchy style, back.	0
is the only question.   is to establish how well lard is made - to estimate quality of manipulative technique. At best, I'm scared.	0
This film is so bad that it is almost worth seeing because it is so bad.	0
A crisp film that is nothing more than slightly amusing.	0
This film feels more like a continuous cry for attention than an attempt at some satisfying entertainment.	0
Overall, it's a pretty mediocre family film.	0
Love may have been in the air on screen, but I certainly didn't feel any of it.	0
Apart from the overcooked, clumsy direction, in which all the actors take the back row, the dialogues sound like terrible poetry.	0
"The very definition of what critics call ""ambitious failure."""	0
It's as if de Palma spent an hour setting a chic table and then served powerful macaroni and cheese.	0
"The film ends with clips in which most of the characters forget their lines and just say ""uhhh,"" which is better than most of the other lyrics in the film."	0
Deserves the gong.	0
Though certainly more naturalistic than its Australian counterpart, Amari's film fails to build the drama of Lila's journey.	0
I found the film as divided against itself as the dysfunctional family it portrays.	0
The film's conscientious serenity, though beautifully imbued with dry absurd wit, eventually becomes too heavy for the plot.	0
The film adds nothing fresh to the myth.	0
As inept as the remake of The Avengers and the Wild West on screen.	0
seems like a relic from a bygone era and its twists.   more silly than plausible.	0
moves in such strange directions and lapses into such news-worthy moralism that its good qualities are hidden.	0
It is a very sincere work, but it would be better than a diary or documentation.	0
Haneke's own sadistic tendencies towards his audience leave a sour taste in his mouth and little else.	0
Oops, she really did it this time. That twittering songbird Britney Spears has emerged with more mindless fuss.	0
It's a despicable film, it really is and it makes absolutely no sense.	0
a cooler that works resolutely without chills.	0
For those of us who are more responsive to storytelling than to computer-generated effects, the new Star Wars episode has not escaped the last digging trench.	0
The director usually plays it straight and turns the fable into a listless climb up the social ladder.	0
"""Bad"" is the operative word for ""bad company,"" and I don't mean good."	0
Although Frida is easier to swallow than Julie's absurd Titus, the eye candy lacks considerable brio.	0
Drumline is -- the mere, if visually compelling suggestion of a fully realized story.	0
The whole film is just a lazy exercise in bad filmmaking that prompts you to suspend not only your disbelief but your intelligence.	0
The film gives us fascinating insights into the insights we have gained from lifelong spiritual research, but this is not the case.	0
Pompous and confused.	0
billy crystal and robert de niro sleepwalk through vulgarities in a sequel that can be rejected.	0
It's loud and boring; it's like being caught in a bad rock concert.	0
She merely throws (and literally) sex toys around, offering half-hearted pathos for empowerment that is repeatedly undermined by the brutality of jokes, mostly at the expense of women.	0
If you want to travel back in time, the 1960 version is a much more pleasant one.	0
And they're fiddling with the kind of pre-chewed racial stereotypes that have already gone through the corporate stand-up comedy mill.	0
The story is - if I may say so - a little thin and the filmmaking clumsy and rushed.	0
is noticeably thinner with its many oversized, uncharacteristic and logically porous action parts.	0
I wish the windtalkers had more faith in the dramatic potential of this true story That would have been better than the fiction she concocted, and there could have been room for the war scenes.	0
Aggressive self-aggrandisement and manipulative whitewashing. Stay in the credits and see a devastating comic impersonation by Dustin Hoffman, which is telling.	0
None of the characters or plot lines are concrete enough to spark interest.	0
As a social exposé, skin has its heart in the right place, but that's not much to hang a soap opera on.	0
The whole film has this sneaky feeling, as if the director is trying to deceive the viewer into thinking everything is very important just because the film is ugly to look at and not a Hollywood product.	0
It's a bit of thematic flesh on the bones of the Queen of the Damned, as its origins dictate in a rice novel by Anne Rice, but generally it's a film that puts style above character and substance.	0
The only way to tolerate this bland, brutally clueless film might be a large dose of pain medication.	0
This one is certainly well-intentioned, but also simple and invented.	0
Coppola has made a film of heady atmosphere and little else.	0
Bad and confusing from the start.	0
A series of immaculately composed shots of Patch-Adams quietly freaking out doesn't make much film.	0
At a time when we have learned the hard way how complex international terrorism is, collateral damage paints an absurdly simplistic picture.	0
the impulses that led to this project.   are laudable, but the results are mixed.	0
A well-acted film that just doesn't work.	0
like a can of 2-day-old cola. You can try it, but there's no mess.	0
There's no excuse for following a gloriously well-made family movie with a computer-generated cold fish.	0
Both the thriller and the love story are unusual. But they don't go well together and neither is well told.	0
It is both sitcom-like and poignant.	0
Aside from a slightly rousing central romance, this is sickening entertainment at best and mind-destroying at worst.	0
jaglom offers the not too original premise that anyone involved in filmmaking is a con artist and liar.	0
Apart from Burger's desire to make some kind of film, it's really unclear why this project was done	0
was I afraid? Not until the prospect of Beck's next project. Let's see, a haunted house, a haunted ship, what comes next.   Ghost plane?	0
A fragile frame on which to hang wide, easily crafted characters invented just 10 minutes before shooting.	0
As the action spreads in an increasingly incoherent manner, one may wish for a clock that passes faster than the other way around.	0
Because Lee is a sentimentalist, the film is more deferential than your random E! True Hollywood story.	0
"Wes Craven's presence is felt; not the craven of ""a nightmare on Elm Street"" or ""the hills have eyes,"" but the sad schlock merchant of ""deadly friend."""	0
The Sunshine State examines the landscape and assesses the issues with a clear passion for sociology. But the cinematography is murky, the picture murky.	0
It's a long way.	0
It gets old fast. If you need a cube, check out the hair salon again - it's not worth it.	0
It's leaden and predictable, and lacks laugh.	0
A cinematic disaster that is so inadvertently trivialised that it is worth the admission fee alone.	0
Skip this filth, rent a shelter and go back to the source.	0
The film is a desperate misjudgment. t give poor dana carvey anything to do that is really funny, and then expect us to laugh because he behaves so stupid all the time.	0
We just don't care too much about this love story. In this environment, their struggle is simply too ridiculous and borderline.	0
the van bombards the spectator with so many explosions and swipes that he ends up surprisingly boring.	0
Uzumaki's interesting social parallel and defiant aesthetic seem like a prostitute muse	0
Men in Black II creates a new threat to the mib, but recycles the same premise.	0
Despite its big budget, the film is such a bright spot on the radar screen that it's tempting to take it along on the ride. But this time the old mib label stands for milder is no better.	0
feels familiar and tired.	0
a retreading of the material, which has already been thoroughly explored by Martin Scorsese	0
Instead of making his own style, director marcus only gives copies from different sources, a bad mix	0
Criminal conspiracies and true romances move so easily across ethnic and cultural boundaries in the film that my grand Greek wedding looks like an apartheid drama.	0
a hole that tends to hit every point home.	0
A story that fails to rise above its sickening source material.	0
It is fitting that a film as artificial and soulless as the country owes its creation to an animated screening at Disneyland.	0
The film begins as an intense political and psychological thriller, but is sabotaged by ticking time bombs and other Hollywood action clichés.	0
Totally creatively stillborn and executed in a way I'm not sure it could be one iota worse.   a soulless pile of exploitative rubbish	0
an uneven view of a bleak future that does not come close to the intelligence and visual brilliance seen in other Philippines films. Gay stories.	0
Horrible	0
The incoherent mess flows as naturally as Jolie's hideous yellow	0
Strengthened by an amazing cast (with the exception of Love Hewitt), interesting ethnic tensions and a story I haven't seen in years.	0
an authentically vague but ultimately futile study in total pandemonium.	0
makes a joke out of chases and then gives us half an hour chases.	0
As the sulky, moody male bungler in the title role, [franco] has all the mannerisms and complacency of the Dean, but none of his sweetness and vulnerability.	0
"The only thing to fear about ""Angstdot com"" is to bang your head on the cinema chair in front of you when you fall asleep for thirty minutes."	0
it is too interested in slipping into all its Byzantine incarnations to entertain its audience.	0
"""Synthetic"" is the best description of this well-meaning, beautifully produced film, which sacrifices its promise of a powerful star pedigree."	0
It focuses far too much on the awkward interaction and total lack of chemistry between Chan and Hewitt.	0
Fraudsters can't come up with anything to do with these characters, except to let them walk through dark tunnels, fend off various anonymous attackers, and evade sophisticated surveillance technologies.	0
Richter's characters should pick out the long-running bestsellers of intelligent women, silly advice.	0
The script has less spice than a rat burger and the martial arts of the rock are more in keeping with Steven Seagal.	0
This ill-conceived and expensive project looks like a bunch of talented theses that it's snoozing about.	0
The whole company has a choppy surface.	0
The film fails to resolve the limited chemistry that Ralph Fiennes and Jennifer Lopez created.	0
A particularly joyless and utterly boring coming-of-age story.	0
It is impossible to indulge in the imaginative daydreams of a janice bart (eileen walsh) when her real personality is so charming and empty.	0
"It wasn't the subject that ultimately defeated the filmite, was the unfulfilling, incongruous ""Wait a minute, did I miss something?"" End."	0
This is a film where the most remarkable observation is how long you sit still.	0
Poor editing, bad bluescreen and ultra-kitsch dialogue underscore the radical action.	0
It's super violent, super serious and super stupid.	0
so serious and well-meaning and so full of talent that one almost forgets the sheer, ponderous horror of the script.	0
Just a bunch of stale gags, with no good inner life and no bite.	0
You can't do it without the jokes.	0
The lock would have benefited from a sharper, cleaner script before going in front of the camera. Not to mention a sharper, cleaner camera lens.	0
Flat, loud and pretentious.	0
Morrissette has indeed done a difficult job - he has recorded one of the most fascinating stories in the world and made it boring, lifeless and irritating.	0
The grandfather of the Nouvelle Vague, Jean-Luc Godard, continues to amaze the faithful with his games of hide and seek.	0
This loud and thoroughly sickening comedy about a bickering working-class couple is a deeply uncomfortable experience.	0
It's better than the phantom threat. But if you're not an absolute Star Wars junkie, it's no fun.	0
Philosophically, intellectually and logistically, it's a mess.	0
A classic police drama that would probably have ended an original without de Niro's involvement.	0
Combining shamefully written dialogue with fluttering body movements that replace acting is the clumsy soap opera-like story.	0
The end of Hollywood just isn't very funny.	0
Though clearly well-intentioned, this intercultural soap opera is painfully formulaic and dull.	0
a technical triumph and an extraordinary bore.	0
I can well imagine the Pinocchio of benigni becoming a Christmas tree. Coal is not as easy to get as it used to be and that would be a worthy substitute for naughty children's stockings.	0
Two hours of rubbish.	0
In the end, it's all about gorgeous costumes, eye-popping, large-scale scenery, and Joan's crazy decision to stand by her husband no matter how often he turns out to be a disloyal satyr.	0
Compulsive, misguided and ill-informed though they may be.	0
A clumsily produced exploitative film, an unstinting exercise in manipulation and chaos.	0
The whole story, true or not, feels incredibly crazy.   [It] comes like a brand advertisement.	0
"What is missing is the so-called ""wow factor."""	0
The nicest thing you can say about stealing crops (which you could call Freddy being harassed by a dog) is that it's not as disgusting as Tom Green's freddy fingers.	0
Tara Reid plays a college journalist, but she looks like the six-time Miss Hawaii winner, so I don't know what she's doing.	0
The young stars are too sweet; the story and the complications that follow are too manipulative; the message is too blatant; the resolutions are too practical.	0
Normally, I'm fascinated by Rohmer's talkies, but when he shifts his setting to the past and relies on a historical text, he loses the richness of characterisation that makes his films so memorable.	0
I highly recommend Irwin, but not in the way this film portrays him.	0
It's been 13 months and 295 previews since I last saw a film, but the evil in the country deserves my outraged, pre-emptive departure.	0
This image is mostly a lump of ordinary profanity, peppered with a few remarks so aimed at generating public sympathy that one might think he is running for office - or trying to win a parole officer.	0
Malone has a gift for creating nightmarish images that are hard to burn from the brain. But the narrative hook of the film is far too muddled to be an effectively chilling pleasure.	0
Although it goes beyond both, anyone who has seen Hunger or Cat Man will find little new here, but a palatable performance of compelling Gallo elevates this story of cannibalistic lust above the ordinary.	0
A witch-style adventure set like a bad soap opera, with passable performances by all the actors.	0
Diaz wears her welcoming greeting in her most charming appearance	0
It's a pity this sympathetic film isn't more complete. The actors make an effort, but come across as amateurish and awkward.	0
The plot has a number of holes, and sometimes it is just confusing.	0
An ill-conceived mess that is not scary, not intelligent and not engaged.	0
"The brainless but pleasurably over-the-top retro-gang melodrama ""Deuces Wild"" represents the machismo of the fifties in a way that borders on crude gay eroticism."	0
is blocked by an excessively stupid plot and a stop-and-start pace.	0
Incredible.   Imaginary pap.	0
"""What John does is heroic, but we don't condone it,"" said one of the film's stars recently, an agonizing comment that perfectly illustrates the image's moral schizophrenia."	0
Like a long-running, well-written TV series in which you've missed the first half-dozen episodes and probably won't see the next six.	0
"This is not a ""waterboy""!"	0
His typical villains lack intrigue (except for their funny accents) and the action scenes are poorly executed.	0
soaked in clichés and no opportunity to trivialise the material.	0
Hardcore slasher fans will find it here.   But overall, the Halloween series has lost its edge.	0
Stiff and schmaltzy and awkward.	0
the story the film tells is about brian de palmas addicted to the droplet-containing suspense verses that almost ruined his career	0

The cinematic equivalent of going to a dinner party and being forced to watch the host and hostess's home video of their baby's birth.	0
[Hill] has learned new tricks, but the tricks alone are not enough to save this lifeless boxing film.	0
"In the real world, an actor of this uncharismatic beauty would have a resume full of credits like ""Girl in Bar 3."""	0
Too much of it feels unfocused and underdeveloped.	0
Under 15? One giggle per minute. Over 15 years? Time wasting.	0
Hey arnold! The film is what happens when you blow small potatoes to ten times their natural size, and it's not pretty.	0
Sometimes it seems less like storytelling than something the otherwise compelling director needed to get off his chest.	0
This is not the undisputed worst boxing film of all time, but it is certainly not a champion - the big loser is the audience.	0
One really has to wonder how on earth anyone, anywhere else, could have believed that they were making the audience watch with such an absolutely diabolical script.	0
In the end, we are left with something like two ships passing by at night, and no insights into gay love, Chinese society, or the price of being dishonest.	0
suffocates at its own representation of the top crust.	0
Almost unbearable.   Although the picture strives to become cinematic poetry, it remains depressingly sober and boring.	0
I thought my own watch had stopped working when I dragged myself through the clock stops.	0
While much of the cast is charming - especially Allodi and Nold - the actors are overwhelmed by the film's primitive approach to comedy.	0
This directorial debut from the music video showdown with Chuchinsky is all flash.	0
Yes, ballistic is stupid. Unfortunately, it's no silly fun if you don't enjoy really bad movies.	0
The twist that ends the film is the one with the most emotional resonance, but the twists become irritating, and this is the kind of material that filmmakers should be very careful to raise eyebrows.	0
The longer the film goes on, the worse it gets, but in the first few minutes it's actually pretty good.	0
While it's really cool to hear characters talk about early rap records (Sugar Hill Gang, etc.) , the constant reference to hip-hop arcana can alienate even the most savvy audience.	0
Not only unfunny, but downright disgusting.	0
Carefully captures the wonder and menace of growing up, but he never really embraces the joy of Fuhrman's destructive escapism or the grace in rebellion his characters find.	0
forced, familiar and thoroughly condescending.	0
does little more than play a harmless game, filling gaps with a tragic past.	0
k-19 exploits our considerable collective fear of the nuclear holocaust to create cheap tensions.	0
has a long and bulky end.   , which forces the audience to wriggle through ten pseudo-serious minutes while waiting for the credits and edited montage of the scenes to break the awkward silence of the audience	0
A hotchpotch of promising ideas and failed narratives, good acting and old bad filmmaking.	0
Wallis's determination to plunge you into sheer, relentless misery is exhausting.	0
unusually stylish, but just as silly.   The picture does not generate much tension, nor does it ask enough questions to justify its claims.	0
The whole film is about a boring, sad man who is boring and sad.	0
The plot twists add up to nothing more than breaking the audience chain.	0
confirms the nagging suspicion that Falk behind the camera would be even worse than before.	0
without recognizable craft and monstrously hypocritical in dealing with the loss of childhood.	0
It's a trifle of a film, with a few laughs around a nondescript soft centre.	0
Holden Caulfield did better.	0
A synthesis of clichés and absurdities that, in its cinematic flash and emptiness, seems almost decadent.	0
Oh, come on. As if you couldn't smell that turkey that rotts for miles	0
if it is rarely boring, then it is rarely conclusive.	0
Simplistic fluffy balls of whimsy.	0
Not exactly the bees	0
There is nothing new about the old story except to show fist fights in this kind of stop-go slow motion that makes the gangster sounds look like they are transmitted via a 28k modem.	0
the kind of spectacularly misguided undertaking that only a sophisticated moviegoer could have committed.	0
provides a truly strange, sometimes confusing children's entertainment.   But at least this time there are a few centered stories that fit all that weird stuff.	0
There are no good jokes, no good scenes, hardly a moment in which Carvey's live Saturday miming rises above the level of embarrassment.	0
Jacqueline's rendition of Puccini's tale of devotion and the double cross is more than a filmed opera. In his first stab at form, Jacquot adopts a slightly anarchic approach that only works sporadically.	0
Chabrol has taken promising material for a black comedy and turned it into a dark chamber play instead.	0
It is like watching a film that was made in 1978 but did not hit cinemas at the time because it was so weak, and which has now been dug up and released where it has become even weaker.	0
This is nothing more than familiar territory.	0
In execution, this clever idea is far less funny than the original, Killer from Space.	0
one of the most irritating cartoons you will see this year or any other.	0
A broad, melodramatic opera of oestrogen, which is itself rather toxic.	0
Too slow, too long and too little.	0
The few ideas of the film are stretched to evaporation; the entire middle section is one big chase that seems to have no purpose or urgency. It's just filler.	0
The value of his archival wealth is sacrificed by his impartial attitude.	0
Roberto Benigni's Pinocchio is an astonishingly bad film that lacks charm, wit and inventiveness.	0
A romantic comedy that turns our girl into the unfortunate agent of an extended cheap shot across the Mason-Dixon border.	0
does not score with originality, wit or intelligence. It's a cookie-cutter movie, a cut-and-paste job.	0
It takes a long time for them to come to their panting end.	0
hardly gets going.	0
Even on the rare occasions when the narrator stops whining, Müller's hand is often uncertain.	0
"Pumpkin is an outrageously dark satire about the life of the fraternity, but its ambitions far exceed the abilities of writer Adam Larson Broder and his co-director Tony R. In her feature film debut ""The Man Who Saved Me."""	0
At its best, Queen is campy fun like the price-horror classics of the 1960s. At worst, it implodes into a series of very bad special effects.	0
Already in the opening scenes it becomes clear that the Benjaminen is a completely formulaic film.	0
"It takes a certain kind of horror film to be classified as ""worse than expected,"" but Ghost Ship somehow manages that."	0
on the bright side it contains jesse ventura's best work since the xml.	0
Despite impeccable behaviour.   and a script that takes some rather unexpected (sometimes even absurd) twists, love is just too precious in the end.	0
A TV thriller with some big screen moments (including one that seems made for a very different film).	0
Having become entangled in the visuals and eccentricities of many characters, I found myself confused when it was time to get to the heart of the film.	0
All too often, the viewer does not react so much to humour, but shrugs in disgust.	0
What's next? Revenge of the Pigs: ultimate release?	0
Dilbert without the right satirical humour.	0
manages to show life in all its banality when the intention is the opposite.	0
You don't see this movie.	0
Minority report is exactly what the title says, a report.	0
delivers the same old, Latin flavoured and made by Hollywood playas.	0
If you believe any of that, I can give you a real deal on leftover Enron shares, which will lose a week's worth starting Friday.	0
"To call the other side of the sky ""appalling"" is to underestimate how dangerous such conversations can be."	0
In exactly 89 minutes, most of which passed as slowly as sitting naked on an igloo, Formula 51 went from quirky to jerky to total turkey.	0
if only the story about a multi-million dollar fraudster bothered to include the scammer.	0
I have to say the star and the director are the big problems.	0
Without the dark creepiness of the Crystal Sea Camp, the horror concept loses its creepy menace completely.	0
It's like every bad idea that's ever flowed into an extracurricular special put together in one place, without the slipperiness and sophistication of these daytime programs (and who knew they had?)	0
While the evil games based there have set new standards for thrills, suspense and gore for video games, the film actually only succeeds in the third.	0
For almost two hours, the audience has to endure three terminally depressed, mostly inarticulate, hyperdysfunctional families at the price of one.	0
To my taste, the cartoon characters in the film come dangerously close to a new generation.	0
What the director can't do is make Val Kilmer's characters interesting or desirable.	0
In an effort, I suspect, not to offend by appearing either too serious or too light-hearted, it insults by simply showing wishful thinking.	0
It is hard to imagine the process that led to such a script, but here it is suggested that spray cheese and underarm noises played a crucial role.	0
Harland Williams is so witty on drag that he should consider having a permanent sex change.	0
Nothing scary here except some terrible actors and lame special effects.	0
It's not that kung fu movies aren't funny sometimes - it's just no funnier than bad martial arts movies being all by themselves, without all of Oedeker's uncouth enhancement.	0
A very long, at times boring film, in which the preparation of meals and the construction of igloo are completely too central.	0
Not an offensive or boring film; it just lacks everything except good intentions.	0
A science fiction pastiche so lacking in originality that if you took your inspiration away, there would be little left.	0
Once [kim] starts exaggerating the shock tactics and lure metaphors, you may decide that the price of a dazzling postcard is too high.	0
"The words ""Honestly, darling, I'm not damning myself"" have never been more apt."	0
"What's next: ""My mom's car?"""	0
all the jazzed-up stunts in the style of a hawk and thrashing rap metal cannot hide the fact that we really did.	0
A sequel that's way too big for its Brits	0
is so relentlessly horrible that being called a dog is probably cruel to dogs.	0
What was once original has been hijacked so often that it now seems pedestrian.	0
is a startling example of unfulfilled promises, despite many charming moments	0
Despite all the twists and turns, tears, anger and opium overdoses, there is no sense that true passion is washed away in the dissolution of love.	0
A gross and stupid gross-out.	0
A nightmare date with half-hearted wit that has done a disservice to the liberal arts academy's lack of critical distance and sad trust in platitudes.	0
offers little but frivolous soullessness, crude language and a series of brutal set pieces.   , which raise the bar for stylized screen violence.	0
There is potential here, but like Lavinia, the film chooses the conservative path.	0
It's a pussy-ass world when even killer thrillers revolve around group therapy.	0
The pared-down approach lends the film a certain timelessness, but the measured pace and lack of dramatic agility can be tiring.	0
But the power of these [subjects] is obscured by the majority of the film, which shows a stationary camera on a subject that could be mistaken for a public speech, rather than contributing to the story of a film.	0
Rarely has so much money brought so little entertainment.	0
tries to add some spice to his quirky feelings, but the taste is too familiar.	0
The total sum paid is so old-fashioned, in fact, that the most vivid scene is a scene in which clips of Brian de Palma's scarf are used. This is a scam.	0
Harrison's flowers put their hearts in the right place, but their brains are not in a particular place.	0
This repetition is so stupid and exploitative in its violence that it ironically becomes everything the somewhat clumsy original railed against.	0
a series of warmed-up gags based on weak vulgarity.	0
The film is the dawn of the dead crossed by the ghosts of Mars, with zombies that are not as spooky as the first and trains that are not as big as the second.	0
Basically a static series of half-improvised (and half-connected) raps between the stars.	0
Too reserved to be a freak show, too mercenary and obvious to be cerebral, too boring and pretentious to engage.   The island eludes a simple classification.	0
an unpredictable mix of buddy smart talk, romantic comedy and dark tragedy that bites far more than writer / director john mckay can swallow	0
It is one of those baseball pictures where the hero is stoic, the wife patient, the children as sweet as any and the chances of success long enough to be intimidating but short enough to make a dream possible.	0
"""The Time Machine"" is a film that has no interest in itself. it doesn't believe in itself, it doesn't have a sense of humour, it just gets bored."	0
A hollow joke, told by a film gymnast who has too much fun glossing over the misanthropic story to actually tell.	0
"A dark little soap opera about three dull, insensitive people hurting each other. It's a full-length adaptation of one of those ""Can this marriage be saved?"" Columns from the Ladies Home Journal."	0
The movie is essentially over.	0
I'm sure if you're a die-hard fan, you'll have fun.   I didn't care.	0
It's about following your dreams no matter what your parents think. Socrates makes applications for hemlock.	0
The script is not very good; not even someone as talented as Hoffman (the actor) can make it work.	0
Walter Hill's mushy, stylised boxing melodrama almost overcomes his questionable fight in the ring with solid fight choreography and raw prison authenticity.	0
It has all the excitement of eating oatmeal.	0
It is hard to say whether to recommend this film or not, because for everything it does right, there are at least one and sometimes two things that always go so wrong.	0
Although there are several truly harrowing horrors, there are also plenty of hackneyed dialogue and silkier diabolical business than shaking your leg.	0
Bet the video game is much more fun than the movie.	0
Star Trek: Nemesis meekly goes where almost every Star Trek movie has gone before. Twitching dialogue, thrifty store costumes, prosthetic make-up with silly putty and Kmart blue-light special effects conspired to test Trekkie loyalty.	0
Like all abstract art, the film does not make this statement in an easily accessible way, and it would be very possible - without warning - for a reasonably intelligent person to sit through its flood of images and not get this vision at all.	0
I don't mind my heart strings being pulled, but don't treat me like a fool.	0
"Although this idea is ""new,"" the results are tired."	0
I suspect the director is a wizard. After all, he took three minutes of dialogue, 30 seconds of action and turned it into a 90-minute film that lasted five hours.	0
an unencouraging triple expansion of the former mtv series, which accompanies the stunt-hungry bigheads in a random series of collected gags, pranks, pratfalls, ventures, injuries etc.	0
The script is a mindless pairing of teenage language and animal cruelty.	0
Its source of thorn and vinegar (and common humanity) has long been plundered by similar works that exhibit the insight and penetration that this image so clearly lacks.	0
Despite her impressive craftsmanship and an overbearing set of crescendos in Act III, Lily chou-chou never really builds emotional steam.	0
Don't be fooled by the impressive cast list - you are, as you can see, rubbish.	0
Since Freddy was fingered, it has not been so painful to sit through a major release.	0
The documentary does little but raise the issue to further stimulate conversation.	0
plays like a fleeting and overlong magazine spread.	0
A better title could sweep under the carpet for all concerned.	0
This film seems to be written with insanity. It cannot be otherwise. Funny and ridiculous.	0
Vera's technical prowess ultimately sells his film as a short film; he even smoothes out hard truths when discovering them.	0
[A] shapeless lump of desperate conversation	0
feels too formulaic and too familiar to produce the cross-border thrill of early underground.	0
Generic thriller junk. Only teenagers.	0
Given the clumsiness and clumsiness, this could be the worst Soderbergh has ever done.	0
a numerically ordered patient / doctor picture covering all the usual	0
A stupid movie with stupid characters doing stupid things and you have to be really stupid not to see where that leads.	0
The theft of crops is a comedic larceny, but is condemned for nothing more than petty theft.	0
Presumption is in its own way a form of courage. For that, and only for that reason - the power of her own staunch, hostile beliefs - Chelsea Wall deserves a medal.	0
With the exception of some fleetingly amusing improvisations by Cedric, the entertainer as Perry's boss, there is no redeeming moment.	0
It's a bag of genres that don't make much sense.	0
Film fans, get ready to stand out.   in the other direction.	0
[Director] o'fallon manages to bring some beautiful images to the big screen, but his ability to tell a story - he also worked on the script - falls short.	0
The intention is almost exactly the same [as all the money]. The only thing missing is spontaneity, originality and joy.	0
No one but a convicted person guilty of a truly heinous crime should have to sit through the master of disguise.	0
Even the best chef can't make a hot dog anything more than a hot dog, and Robert de Niro can't make this movie more than a trashy cop buddy comedy.	0
The second half is too deceitful, and what began as a fascinating look at youth fizzles out into a tedious, ridiculous attempt at heartbreak.	0
It's not without its pleasures, but I stick to it.	0
Müller plays so freely with emotions and the fact that children are hostages to happiness that he makes the audience hostage to his swaggering seriousness.	0
Despite the evocative aesthetic that hints at the hollow state of modern love life, the film never goes beyond a monotonous whine.	0
maudlin rather than sharp.	0
This is a selfish endeavor by the daughter of horror director Dario Argento (here a producer), but her raw performance and utter fearlessness make it strangely attractive.	0
It's slow - very, very slow. It's not the ultimate gangster movie of depression. It's pure PR hype.	0
Characters still need to function on a set of credible and understandable impulses, no matter how many drugs they take or how much artistic license Avary uses.	0
Uncomfortably close to swimming in the footsteps of the bicycle thief.	0
Visually stunning, but ultimately a pretty-looking boredom, the real creativity would be to completely hide the treasure planet and reinvent it.	0
Harvest theft is proof that the Farrelly Bros. -- Peter and Bob -- and their kind of screen comedy are coming to an end, along with Green's half-hearted film career.	0
There seems to be no clear path to where the story is going or how long it will take to arrive.	0
If you are a WWF fan, or you are related to the people who watched the robots being slaughtered in an abattoir.  you will probably like rollerball.	0
I don't think I ever laughed out loud. And when you talk about slapstick comedy, that's a pretty big problem.	0
It's so mediocre, despite the dynamic duo in the marquee, that we just can't be satisfied.	0
Slapstick stupidity can tickle the imagination of some preschoolers, but if it costs a family of four about $40 to see a movie at the cinema, why spend money on such a dog when you can hire a family tree instead?	0
becomes so unforgivably banal in the last 10 minutes that anyone who doesn't have a sweet tooth is likely to fall into a sugar shock.	0
The idea that bombing buildings is the funniest thing in the world goes completely unheeded in this stunningly unfunny comedy.	0
my reaction in one word: disappointment. His last film was poetically romantic and full of indelible images, but his last one is something special.	0
It kind of works and sometimes qualifies as cool, but it's just too lame to work or be cool.	0
maintains its dream-like glide through a succession of cheesy coincidences and sensual cheap effects, not least through Rebecca romijn-stamos	0
Fascinating documentary, emotionally diluted by focusing on the least interesting subject.	0
A mystery.	0
feels arbitrary, as if the writers mistakenly thought they could create an air of frantic spontaneity by simply throwing in lots of characters doing stupid stuff and stirring the pot.	0
What an embarrassment.	0
Each giggle comes with at least 10 complete misses, many of them from the astonishingly lifelike Tara Reid, whose acting skills are comparable to a cardboard cutout.	0
In its own way, Joshua is as blasphemous and nonsensical as a Luis Buñuel film without its intelligence, poetry, passion and genius.	0
I've always dreamed of taking part in canned food, but after seeing this film, it's no big deal.	0
The vintage is pure '87, with a half-hearted twist on his cautionary message: fatal attraction = not having an affair with a weirdo; unfaithful = not when married.	0
There is a workshop mentality.	0
It cannot be enjoyed, not even at the level of enjoying a bad slasher movie, especially because it is boring. Yes, boring.	0
Pumpkin wants both.	0
Director uwe boll and the actors offer little reason to care in this crude 1970s throwback.	0
[W] e have long depended on amiable monkeys and dignified environmental protection, Jane Goodall's wild chimpanzees lack the thrill that the oversized medium demands.	0
Space fans may love this movie, but others will only experience its delights occasionally.	0
"This Channel 5 ""s Grade 5 trash is, frankly, an insult to the intelligence of the true genre enthusiast."	0
an occasionally funny but overall saggy story from the water.	0
a bloated gas bag thesis, grotesquely impressed by its own gigantic aura of self-importance.	0
It is mightily exhausting for the viewer, who has to contend with unpleasant characters, messed-up performances and awkwardly staged scenes.	0
turns out to be a sudsy tub of supernatural hocus pocus, not even ms Redgrave's noblest efforts can free him from hopeless sentimentality.	0
The Playboy Mansion presentation of the new best friend about college life is ridiculous.	0
"A horrible ""ace ventura"" rip-off that somehow manages to bring Kevin Pollak, former wrestler Chyna and Dolly Parton together If one of them lists this ""credit"" on his CV in the future, it will be much funnier than anything in the film."	0
The humour is forced and ponderous and sometimes just unpleasant.	0
Scorsese at his best makes gangster films that are equally beautiful, but also mercilessly brutal and brutally intelligent; Destruction, on the other hand, reads more like Driving Miss Daisy than Goodfellas.	0
Although the script begins promisingly, it loses momentum towards the middle and never really develops beyond obvious attacks.	0
"As the latest bid in the ""TV-to-Movie"" franchise game, i spy is hitting the cinema screen with little of the annoying originality of its groundbreaking predecessor."	0
It's not even Madonna's. This is their blue lagoon.	0
The director knows how to apply textured luster, but his portrait of sex as war is strictly sitcom.	0
The film suffers from a lack of humor (something that is needed to balance the violence).	0
Burns never really makes the energetic cast useful.	0
is an overstated, crazy and ultimately tiring sex farce.	0
has all the depth of a paddling pool.	0
This is the kind of massive action flick in which one accident blows over another, the narrative necessity is a drunken carousel, and anything that conforms to logic is a factor in the last remaining plot.	0
the so-called inept- it's-surreal dubbing (with the voices of glenn close, regis philbin and breckin meyer) evokes memories of kitschy old patchwork films.	0
The film is just an old monster.	0
If this disposable cloth has a wildcard, it's John Turro, who simply passes as a Spanish butler with foot fetish.	0
a long chain of clichés.	0
A noble failure.	0
A real downer? [leigh] lays it on so thick this time it feels like a suicide run.	0
It's tempting to jump on a ship in January to avoid ridiculous sloppiness like this sloppy thriller.	0
Nelson's brutally unsentimental approach.   sucks humanity out of the film, leaving a terrible but strangely emotionless spectacle.	0
with its disturbingly close look at the damaged psyche and its subtle undercurrents of danger. But its clumsy structure breaks the spell.	0
unbaked and overheated.	0
There's a solid women's and self-discovery story somewhere here, but you'd have to dig pretty deep to find it.	0
I still can't identify with Stuart: he's a mouse, for example, he screams loudly, and all he does is milk it with despondent eyes and moan that no one is treating him humanely enough.	0
[Serry] wants to combine politics and drama, an admirable goal. It's a pity that the helping hand he uses to stir up his ingredients is also heavy.	0
by the lousy standards to which the slasher genre has fallen.   Pretty good, actually. For more objective measurements, it is still pretty bad.	0
The only entertainment you will draw from this choppy and sloppy affair is the unintentional giggling of several of them.	0
At school, the method of soft landing and easy ways out prevailed.	0
lástima por schwarzenegger, pero es hora de que deje la estafeta a las nuevas generaciones.	0
is exactly what it claims to be - a simple distraction for children.	0
Its story may be a thousand years old, but why did it seem to take another thousand years to tell us?	0
Chillingly pretentious.	0
The problem with this film is that it lacks focus. I sympathise with the plight of these families, but the film does not do a very good job of conveying the theme.	0
A momentary escape from the summer heat and sedentary doldrums that have set in at this time of year.	0
Think of it as an American cake on Valium.	0
Dull, lifeless and amateurish.	0
"""Based on true events,"" a mixture of language that suggests that it is impossible to claim that it is ""based on a true story."""	0
"An act as lumpy as two-day old porridge.   The filmmakers ""paws were, sadly, on this"" not very strong ""project!"	0
Irritating rubbish.	0
It's bad when a movie has about as much substance as its credits.	0
"With its dogged Hollywood naturalism and its characters ""inexorable transition to sainthood, Windtalkers is nothing more than sticky-sweet soap."	0
Some of it is clever, but never melodic /	0
A relative decline.	0
Better just call it abc kiarostami. for aid and Africa are no more than part of the landscape.	0
No social import aspirations characterise the film. This is a shameless sham designed to exploit the popularity of its stars.	0
manages to be played reasonably well, not badly staged and absolutely non-committal, no matter how hard it tries to be exciting, touching or, oops, upset.	0
Warmed-up hash.	0
This rather superficial middle-brow arthouse film knows how to satisfy an audience, and that's about all it does well.	0
It is clear that the filmmakers were not sure where they wanted their story to go, and even more clear that they lacked the skills to get us to this indefinite destination.	0
as vulgar as it is banal.	0
It's a puzzling experience.	0
You wonder why enough was not just a music video, but a long film.	0
The sound and tempo of the film are almost off the mark.	0
the talented and clever robert rodriguez has perhaps given his first film a little too much and not reserved enough for his second.	0
More tearful downer than corrupting comment.	0
Tambor and Clay make him an attractive couple, he's unobtrusive and sardonic, she's attractively manic and energetic. Both deserve better.	0
Choked by its fiddly script and cramped characters, this grumpy adaptation is all the more annoying because it was packed by Hollywood and sold back to us.	0
coughs and stutters at his own postmodern imagination.	0
a completely contradictory emotional experience.	0
Sit through this and you won't need a magic clock to stop time; your DVD player will do it for you.	0
A sometimes tiring film.	0
Teen movies have really gone mad.	0
There are gaps large enough to swim through Shamu the killer whale.	0
plays like someone who transforms random moments from a chrysalis-rock routine into an otherwise clichéd but self-serious agent thriller.	0
Evil, ugly, pointless and depressing, even if you hate clowns.	0
What is missing here is a script of even the most elementary literacy, a sense of real wit and something like acting.	0
Some memorable images.   , but makhmalbaf keeps his distance from the figures	0
It uses the pain and violence of war as background material for color.	0
Just not campy enough	0
Directed by Mike Jackson, the film leaves no cliché untouched, from the predictable plot to the characters that come straight from the central cast.	0
It's everything you don't go to the movies for.	0
Like a dress rehearsal the week before the show: Everything is in place, but something goes wrong.	0
the affectionate rascal that Demme once seemed innate, has a hard time distinguishing between the poorly dated cutesy pie mystery scenario and the newly fashionable Hollywood post-production effects.	0
For all its technical virtuosity, the film is so entangled in youthful and almost xenophobic pedagogy that it is enough to set a jaw for the day when God can no longer handle the rigors of filmmaking.	0
The American chai encourages shabby laughter at stereotypes that only an Indian would recognize. And the lesson is nothing new.	0
It made me tear my eyes out of my head and throw them at the screen.	0
Due to some weaknesses in the script and the casting of the director's brother, the film becomes irrelevant.	0
Holes so large and obvious that a brass band in clown costumes stomps through them and plays a college football song on untuned instruments.	0
so devoid of any comprehensible story that movies like xxx and collateral damage seem like thoughtful essays	0
With its combination of fast editing and rumbling heavy metal, it seems to have the illusion of making the latest downvideo.	0
Dragonfly has no atmosphere, no suspense - nothing but expensive running away. It's a no-brainer.	0
works hard to establish round characters, but then has nothing new or particularly interesting to say about them.	0
The plot switches between past and present, but the material connection is too weak to anchor the emotional ties that supposedly span a 125-year gap.	0
"The nonsensical, boring ""cyber-horror"" film is a dark, hollow exercise in shallow fear and bad acting."	0
Instead of hiding Pinocchio from critics, Miramax should have hidden it from everyone.	0
manages to be both repulsively sadistic and worldly.	0
A great ensemble cannot lift this concern from the heart.	0
There should be a judge's licence to remove burns.	0
The structure the film takes could see Matt Damon and Ben Affleck reunite in search of what remains, as this officially concludes a hunting trilogy never planned.	0
While last year's exemplary sexy beast seemed to revive British gangster film, this equally brutal outing merely upholds it.	0
a boring parade of talking heads and technical gibberish that will do little to advance the cause of Linux.	0
Perhaps Green wants to hang on to that ski mask, because robbery might be the only way to finance his next project.	0
I can understand childish humour.   But that's the kind of infantility that makes you think about changing the director and writer's diapers.	0
There's not nearly enough fun here, despite some attractive ingredients.	0
The story of tok (andy lau), an elegant sociopath in the footsteps of o (takashi sorimachi), the most legendary Asian hitman, is too scattered to grasp.	0
Directed in one color by numbers.	0
a cheerful but unforgettable rip-off of [Besson's] earlier work.	0
a lacklustre, insignificant sequel to the classic Disney adaptation by J. I am. Barrie's peter pan.	0
Samira Makhmalbaf's new film Tablets resembles the ethos of a stream of consciousness, though it is unfortunate for viewers that the thoughts and reflections that permeate it are dull and banal	0
Routine, harmless distraction and little else.	0
The stiffness of a late marriage is unlikely to produce the emotional clout that makes it.  Spectators off their feet.	0
This time sir. Burns tries something in Martin Scorsese Street-realistic mode, but his self-referential sentimentality gets him up.	0
"While it's funny in itself when Sir Anthony Hopkins says, ""Get in the car, bitch,"" this Jerry Bruckheimer production has little else to offer"	0
It is hampered by a lifetime of action and a leading lady who comes from her depth.	0
"Let's hope so. -- that the ""true story,"" by which all the Queen's men are supposedly ""inspired,"" was staged much funnier and cleverer than what was cobbled together on screen."	0
Is there a group of women who are more absorbed in themselves than mother and daughters in this film? I don't think so. There was nothing wrong with the performances here, but the moody characters bothered me.	0
There is very little fear or apprehension, and while I like the creepy ideas, they are not implemented with more than superficial skill.	0
If you ever had the idea of doing what the title of this film implies, which is actually having sex with strangers, this idea could oust you forever.	0
In the end, despite the best efforts of director Joe Carnahan, the film collapses on its shaky foundation.	0
Adults would like the film to be less simplistic, blatant, clumsy and superficial. But what do adults do in the theatre?	0
Sticky sweet sentimentality, heavy-handed conspiracies, and a rosy myopic view of life in the Wwii-era Mississippi Delta undermine this adaptation.	0
It's another stale kill-by-numbers movie, complete with wafer-thin characters and terrible, wordy dialogue.	0
Every time you look, the sweet home abama takes another wrong turn.	0
If you look at this sugary, Easter-coloured concoction, you'll see that it consists of three episodes of a rejected TV programme.	0
The overall effect is less like a children's movie and more like a recruitment film for future Hollywood sales.	0
Given the sluggishness of the drama, the weight of the water is appropriately overstated.	0
It's a fun treat, not least for fans of Malcolm in the Middle and his pubescent star Frankie Muniz	0
Jason x is positively anti-Darwinian: nine sequels and 400 years later, teenagers are no wiser and Jason is still killing on autopilot.	0
To say that this has been done better in wilder areas is like saying the sun is rising in the east.	0
At least you don't know much more about Derrida when you enter the theatre.	0
The actors are likeable, but Elysian fields are idiotic and absurdly sentimental.	0
Like 'chick flicks', this film is rather pathetic, resorting to string-pulling rather than legitimate character development and intelligent plot.	0
The only excitement comes when the credits finally roll and you are allowed to leave the theatre.	0
there is no emotional impulse for solar With an emotional sterility that matches her surroundings in space, Soderbergh's spectacular swing for the fence only adds a spectacular touch.	0
It cannot decide whether it wants to be a mystery / thriller, a romance or a comedy.	0
Denis o'neill's script avoids the cliché of elite sport, a last-second goal to win the championship, but it neglects few others.	0
The zigzag figure is not developed enough to support a film around it.	0
is one of these paintings, whose promising, if rather precious premise is undermined by amateurism.	0
Sarah's serving process doesn't exactly raise laughs.	0
The most hopelessly monotonous film of the year, only conspicuous by its gimmick that it was shot in a single, uninterrupted 87-minute shot.	0
Chelsea is a triple challenge that has virtually no interesting elements to it.	0
Stale, pointless scenario.	0
Deathly boring, entangled in intricate melodrama, nonsensical jargon and stiff upper lip.	0
A misogynistic piece of filth that wants to impersonate hip, young adult entertainment.	0
like the residents of Chelsea.   Burdette's collage-like scenario tends to over-romanticize the struggling artist's spiritual desolation.	0
It's basically an overlong episode of stories from the crypt.	0
The film makes a fatal mistake: it asks us to look after a young man whose only obvious virtue is that he is not quite as unpleasant as some people in his life.	0
Another in-your-face wallows in the depths of people who have never sung this blues.	0
"Wobbly close-ups of turkey on wheels, stubble chins, liver spots, red noses and the filmmakers ""new wobbly puppets might induce a slight giggle, but they lead nowhere."	0
I can't really recommend it - it's too patched up - but I can almost; it's the kind of film that makes you want to like it.	0
Total lack of originality, cleverness or even visible commitment	0
Though Perry and Hurley make an inspiring effort to breathe life into the incoherent, haphazard screenplay of Jay Scherick and David Ronn, neither the actors nor director Reginald Hudlin can make it more than entertaining.	0
Something like a Japanese chalice through a mirror glass, but it seems to take itself much more seriously.	0
It takes talent to make a lifeless film about the most vile man who ever lived.	0
Overall, the film lacks wit, emotion and credibility to compensate for its relentless coarseness and banality.	0
The story and friendship run in such a way that one sees a soap opera rather than a chronicle of the ups and downs of lifelong friendships.	0
offers little real romance and even less laughter.   A sad sitcom of a film, largely without charm.	0
makes for a rather unpleasant viewing experience.	0
The film does not do justice to the sum of its parts.	0
Although Hupert's intensity and concentration elicit a raw enthusiasm, the piano teacher is anything but fun.	0
It shows Carvey's talent for voices, but not nearly enough and not without a drop of patience to get to the good.	0
Bad. Very bad. Dull, baffling, mind-numbing.	0
The discussion about Kennedy's murder may be rekindled, but this fictional film seems more made for cable than the big screen.	0
If you are looking for an exciting science fiction film, you should not settle for this impostor.	0
Not really bad, but tasteless: we now need kidnapping dramas like Doomsday Crimes.	0
The result is a gaudy bag of stale sweets, something from a late Halloween.	0
is so in love with her own creation that she does not see how unbearable the character is.	0
The Man from the Elysian Field is a cold, hapless work that groans along and comes up with an important commentary on how life throws us some seductive turns.	0
The messages of compassion and mercy are explained clearly, directly and specifically through computer-animated Old Testament narration of Jonah and the whale. The humor, which wanted to make fun and hop with energetic musicals, did not exactly delight this adult.	0
Historical dramas fused with love triangle are a familiar conceit. But this film lacks the passion to sell the material.	0
Long dead? not nearly long enough.	0
Nothing more substantial than an unpredictably clever doodle.	0
A solid film.   but more conscientious than it really stirs.	0
It is not enough to justify the almost two hours.	0
The X-ray potion imparts supernatural powers to the quickly named flowers, bubbles and buttercups, which include extraordinary strength and laser eyes that unfortunately do not enable them to recognize flimsy scripts.	0
In his vision of a newly emerging industrialized world politics, perceptible as a new art form, but far too clunky, didactic and burdened with scenes that simply don't fit this film.	0
Verbinski uses every hack-artist trick to give us the ghosts.	0
McConaughey's fun to watch, the dragons are okay, not much fire in the script.	0
an unwise amalgam of news and vibes	0
People's skin has a right to yawn, and we have a right to our salt grains.	0
Who needs such love?	0
When it comes to comedy, it's all about the plot, which is a big flaw.	0
Sandler, who also serves as a producer, has made a film that makes previous vehicles look smart and brash.	0
exists as an occasionally revealing acting exercise.	0
Banal, banal, clichéd, mostly harmless.	0
Mattei is tiresomely earnest and long-winded, as if the circular shape itself indicated profundity.	0
It's not original, and, deprived of the element of surprise, it has no great laughs in its story of irresponsible policemen who enjoy playing pranks.	0
Unless his story is distorted by idiocy with a lost u.  Satellite, Hunter - with Irwin and his American wife / colleague Terri - is a film children should enjoy.	0
It offers little of the current joys of pretty and weightless intellectual entertainment.	0
A succession of ridiculous shootings.	0
Nothing waking up in Reno has ever inspired me to see its residents as more than markers in a script.	0
I'm just too bored to care.	0
Irwin is a man with enough charisma and audacity to make a dozen films, but this particular result is ultimately discouraged from being something bigger.	0
No stereotype is left out, no cliché remains unsaid.	0
As its title suggests, this pipette with a pg-13 value is ultimately as threatening as the fabric softener.	0
The attempts of this ensemble film to convey a message are so clumsy that they overburden the audience.	0
It all feels like a Monty Python sketch that's gone horribly wrong.	0
Nerve breakdowns are not entertaining.	0
Scorsese doesn't give us a character worth talking about.	0
a beautifully made piece of uncontrollable noise.	0
like an eternal grimace party.   How can something so brutal be so boring?	0
It's so bad.	0
Even cinematography needs a bit of gravity, beyond good hair and hump.	0
I was sad for lise less because of what happened than because she was captured by this film when she obviously belongs in something lighter and sunnier, for example, by Rohmer.	0
Apart from the sensible toys, there is little to love about this little English thing.	0
This is the wreck of an action film - a baffling attempt by the filmmakers to squeeze James Bond into the brainless mold and throw 40 years of film history into the toilet in favour of bright flashes and loud bang.	0
The film is flat when it should be at its peak, and is more a missed opportunity and trifle than a dark, decadent truffle	0
It is played in the most straightforward way, with little humor to ease things. The clumsy film is almost laughable.	0
"Van Wilder brings a whole new meaning to the term ""comedy gag. At least one scene is so disgusting that viewers may find it hard to keep their lunch."	0
A disappointment for those who love alternative versions of the Bard, especially those involving deep fryers and hamburgers.	0
The film tries too hard to be funny and too much to be hip. The end result is a film that is neither.	0
Every nanosecond of the new guy reminds you that you could do something much more pleasant. Something like toilet scrubbing. or drain rat traps. or settle the taxes of the last year with your ex wife.	0
scooby dooby doo / and shaggy too / you look good and sound too. / but daphne, you're too buff / fred thinks he's tough / and velma - wow, you lost weight!	0
Is the time really right for a warmed-up James Bond adventure starring a village idiot as 007 clone?	0
There is enough melodrama in this magnolia primavera to make Pta proud, but the director's characters are less worthy of Puccini than daytime television.	0
However much it may please those who love movies that bang out pop songs, young science fiction fans will run away disgusted.	0
the humor is not as sharp, the effects not as innovative, and the story not as imaginative as in the original. But it could have been worse.	0
Some of her jokes work, but most fail miserably, and in the end the pumpkin is far more offensive than funny.	0
Even horror fans may not find what they're looking for every day; the film lacks both thrills and humour.	0
"The film ""The Lives of Others"" comes across as a rejected abc after-school special, freshened up by the imbecile of a script class.    Instead, ""Crossroads"" provokes a handful of unintentional howls and numerous yawns."	0
It seems to me that the film is about the art of ripping people off without ever letting them know they've done it	0
It's just disappointingly superficial - a film that has all the elements needed for a fascinating character study, but never does more than scratch the surface.	0
The title describes not only the main characters, but also the lazy people behind the camera.	0
Sometimes it feels like it was made in the 70s or 80s, with cheesy chases and Goldie Hawn.	0
Shaeffer needs to find a hook on which to hang his stubbornly useless films, and it might as well be the revival of the medieval figure.	0
overwhelms most viewers.	0
The story drifts so relentlessly into clichés about tortured (and tortured) artists and consuming but impossible love that you can't help but be disappointed as each revised new sequence continues.	0
It is worth mentioning that the stage design and interior of the ghost ship are more than effectively creepy and atmospheric. So I did.	0
Shamelessly fussy and, worse, fleeing his own provocative subject.	0
Aggravating and tiring.	0
The ring just left me cold and wet, as if I were in the drizzle without rain gear.	0
the film seems to have an empty weight. The lack of pace kills them, though that would be entirely appropriate in a film about cancer.	0
For anyone who grew up on Disney's Treasure Island in 1950, or who remembers the 1934 classic pilot, he feels like a cheat.	0
a clinging, indulgent and overbearing travelogue and invective.   Well, just like that. Watching the scarlet diva, you're ready for temptations, raw insights or both. Instead, we just get messy rage, a movie as personal therapy.	0
Underwater mess: It's so bad that it's good, but only if you get involved in a commercial.	0
The end is a police operation. what happens to john q? I have no idea what I am.	0
has the feel of an unedited personal journal.	0
Remember when Bond had more glamour than shouting? End.	0
and let the cheese dogs slip.	0
This charming nonsense comes amid clanking movie references that make jays and mute Bob's excellent adventure seem understated.	0
"It didn't quite deserve the gong, but there are more intriguing acts than ""confessions of a dangerous mind"""	0
the subject of swinging seems ripe for a documentary - only this one not.	0
Hudlin is stuck trying to light a fire with wet leaves.	0
Unlike his directorial efforts, la femme nikita and the professional, the transporter lacks Besson's perspective as a narrator.	0
The overall effect is so utterly nonsensical that one would have to be mightily bored to even think of staying for, say, ten years.   Three minutes.	0
It lacks depth.	0
Most of the supporting characters in Ostwood's films are weak, as are most of the subplots. This one is weaker than most.	0
There is no real reason to see it and no real reason not to.	0
The audience will find no mention of political prisoners or persecutions that paint the Castro regime in less than holy tones.	0
Subdued and lifeless	0
The film takes too long to get to the good stuff, and then too long to figure out what to do next.	0
You can practically smell the patchouli oil.	0
To say this is De Niro's best film since meeting his parents sums up the sad state of his recent career.	0
The actors do not live in their roles - they are trapped in them, forced to change their behaviour in bizarre, unjustified ways, and engage in dialogues that are mostly platitudes.	0
an often deadly boring, strange reading of a classic whose witty dialogues are treated with an astonishing nonchalance	0
This film was made to make the slowest person in the audience laugh - just pure slapstick with lots of stupid, harmless screams and exaggerated facial expression.	0
consists of a plot and jokes that are too often made by much more talented people than Ali G.	0
Another week later, another college came along that got out of hand.	0
Laughable, irretrievably awful.	0
Moderately rousing despite bargain basement photos and hackneyed romance.	0
there is no insight into the agony of Heidi's life - just a depiction of pain, today's version of the Greek tragedy, the talk show guest suing her fate.	0
The editing is chaotic, the photography grainy and poorly focused, the writing unintentionally hilarious, the direction unfocused, the performances wooden.	0
When [de palma] is bad, he is really bad, and femme fatale is one of the worst he has done.	0
The tadpole is a symbol of the mindless ageism that films suffer from: young is cool and too young is too cool.	0
I doubt anyone will remember the picture when Christmas really is over, but maybe it will be on video.	0
Unsure of tone.   A confused exercise in sexual politics, a shorthand for very bad things.	0
It ends well, and rest assured, the awareness-raising lessons are packed with crass gags.	0
The only thing worse than your inferior, everyday Hollywood image is the fear-ridden attempt to be profound.	0
If you think Jennifer Lopez has displayed poor judgment in planning to marry Ben Affleck, wait until you see girls in Manhattan.	0
Stars like Matthew Perry and Eliza Hurley are more than giggles, and more jokes land than crash, but ultimately the service to Sara is no different from the herd.	0
The best way to avoid imprisonment is to stay with the boring, nerdy people living here.	0
Culkin exudes no charm or charisma that would have even remotely interested a broader audience in his rugged character.	0
Ultimately, the only justification for this bundle is the director's shared but unexplored fascination with the frustrated maniac.	0
(Like) channel surfing between the discovery channel and a late night action movie.	0
A film that more or less meanders through soggy Paris, with an uncomfortable tongue in its cheek.	0
"Perhaps ""artistically"" shot with hand-held cameras and apparently without film light by Joaquin Baca-asay, the low-budget production teeters annoyingly between vertigo and opacity."	0
Imagine a really bad West Side Story production without the songs.	0
Soul is what every character in this film and thus the film itself lacks.	0
An entry pony whose few T & A bits still can't save themselves from being unoriginal, unfunny and unrecommended.	0
The worst kind of independent; the one in which actors dress up and wriggle clumsily as they try to strike lightning bolts, as their 1970s predecessors did	0
It may be a prize winner, but Teacher is a bomb.	0
the production values up there. The use of cgi and digital ink and ink makes things really smooth. The voices are good, too. The problem, with most of these things, is the script.	0
It has its heart in the right place, but withers after a while.	0
proves that a film about kindness is not the same as a good film.	0
Well, it goes on forever.	0
This overproduced and generally disappointing effort is unlikely to wake up the rush hour crowd.	0
Topkapi is not.	0
If Sheikh Sheikh wanted to tell a story about a man who loses his faith, why didn't he just do it instead of using bad science fiction as a shop window?	0
Ethan Hawke has always seen himself as the bastard child of the Beatnik generation, all over his Chelsea.	0
Equal parts bodice-ripper and defiant costume drama	0
I'm not suggesting you actually watch it, unless you're the kind of person who has seen every Wim Wenders film of the 1970s.	0
While the film goes wrong on all levels, the biggest drawback is the lack of laughter in a comedy.	0
If you liked the 1982 film then, you will still like it today.	0
a 93-minute summary of a 26-part television series, with all the pitfalls you would expect.	0
Guillen rarely goes below the surface. She lists ingredients but never stirs.	0
It's safe to assume that viewers will only suspend their incredulity until now - and that doesn't include the 5 o'clock shadow on the big wooden child when it comes to school.	0
To imagine the life of the potter as a martial arts adventure told by a lobotomised woody Allen is to have an idea of the fate facing moviegoers lured into the mediocrity that is kung-fu: into the fist.	0
It causes chills and persistent discomfort, but fails in its quest for deeper meanings.	0
The credibility level is low and character development is a foreign concept.	0
I would rather have a transfer to the hall It was Holland's class for the music, or Robin Williams's lecture, so I could listen to a teacher with humour, passion and drive.	0
The ingredients are largely there. But Nettelbeck's unwillingness to go beyond the surfaces of her characters prevents the film from coming together.	0
a serious, heartbreaking look at the gap between religious fundamentalists and their homosexual relatives. It is also clumsy and devotes too much time to bigoted opinions.	0
A sullen, implausible platonic romance that makes Chaplin's City Lights seem factual by comparison.	0
Yes, one enjoys watching Joan grow from an awkward young woman into a strong, determined monarch, but her love of the philandering Philip only diminishes her stature	0
It's a film that depends on its cast, and Glover really doesn't fit the role.	0
This is a discarded junk food film whose rap soundtrack was better than the film itself.	0
With the candy-like flavor fading faster than 25-cent chewing gum, I realized that this is a throwaway film that won't work. It's a small thing.	0
Nothing in the pool is new, but if you grew up watching the stalker movies of the 1980s, you should enjoy these 90 minutes.	0
Probably the most stupid and incoherent film of the year.	0
But for one reason or another, the scrum soon becomes a terrible drama. After that, it just gets silly and maudlin. It's a shame, but thanks to some lovely comedic moments and some fine performances, it's not a total loss.	0
Chao was Kaig's assistant in China for years. He didn't learn that movies are about telling.	0
A mixture of a comedy that cannot really be described as out of this world.	0
Bulky device.	0
The film is a travesty of the genre and takes itself too seriously as a parody.	0
combines the amateurishness of the Blair Witches project with the illogic of the seventh series: the contenders for a completely stark and unforgettable film.	0
The Piano Teacher is the kind of film that keeps American audiences from ever wanting to see a foreign film again.	0
If it's another action movie you're following, there's no better movie than Half a Sixpence.	0
So what's the point? Lovingly choreographed bloodshed in a pristine film, basically.	0
This is junk food cinema at its best.	0
When everything is wet, it's very pleasant. But when it's dry, this surfer-girl melodrama begins to snap like a stranded grouper.	0
Most new films have a radiant sheen. Some, like ballistic, come stillborn.   Looks like the worn-out, seven-year-old videotape cover.	0
The story is poignant, of course, but first-time screenwriter Paul Pender overloads it with sugary business bits.	0
you see robert de niro singing - and dancing - west side story show tunes Choose your reaction: a.) This is certainly funny!  That is certainly pathetic!	0
A sermonising and lifeless declaration of love to teenagers.	0
This dramatically shaky contest of wills merely repeats the old Hollywood saw: evil is interesting and good is boring.	0
Soon after, the film begins to play like a hospital traversed by a Saturday live spoof of Dog Day.	0
The charm of deliberate eccentricity, as this latest cinematic essay proves, is beginning to wane.	0
Rather than telling a terrible true story, the film is determined to be the next Texas chainsaw massacre. But what about the countless other people who just want to see a solid story about a universally interesting soul?	0
A silly, revelatory film about a silly, revelatory filmmaker	0
Scarlet Diva has a voyeuristic tug, but all in all she's much less sensational than she wants to be.	0
The character is too forced and over-written to be funny or credible most of the time, and clay doesn't always enhance the exaggerated mix.	0
Shrill, pretentious and as impenetrable as Morvern's thick working-class Scottish accent.	0
A battle between cheek theatre and matinee.	0
The film is virtually without context - journalistic or historical. Worse, Pelosi knows it.	0
"Instead, go rent ""Shakes the Clown,"" a much funnier film with a similar theme and an equally great performance by Robin Williams."	0
Lame, haphazard teen comedy.	0
"It's the kind of film that ends up gracing the U.  Art House canvases for no other reason than the fact that it is in French (well, mostly) with English subtitles and therefore magically ""significant."""	0
This pathetic excuse from a film runs empty because you think the flat-bush machismo will prevail.	0
You expect to be reminded of other, better films, especially seven that director William Malone slavishly copies.	0
The film is crammed with dance, henna, ornaments and group singing, but its narrative clichés and telegraphed episodes smell like old soap operas.	0
It's getting harder and harder to ignore the fact that Hollywood isn't laughing with us. it laughs at us.	0
might have done better as a documentary, with less of Mr. Eyre's uninspired drama and more of his sense of observation and outrage.	0
Every good actor has to do his part. For Benigni, it was Pinocchio, not Shakespeare, that defined his career It might as well have been a problem child.	0
Arnold's leap from the small screen to the big screen will leave frowns on some faces.	0
terrible and attractive at the same time.	0
The lack of opposing viewpoints quickly becomes tiresome - the film feels more like a series of toasts at a testimonial dinner than a documentary.	0
Nothing practical is worth sending home.	0
What remains is a superficial snapshot which, however engaging, is insufficiently revealing and inviting.	0
Helmer Devito.   tries to do too many things in this story about ethics, payola, vice, murder, children's television and revenge.	0
It would not be my preferred way to spend 100 minutes or $7.	0
I hated every minute of it.	0
[t] elle extremes prevent us from taking his message seriously, and the mentality of stepwives does not work in a modern context.	0
obvious politics and rudimentary animations reduce the chances of attracting hey arnold! The film will go far beyond its core demographic.	0
It is clear that this hybrid misses the impact of the Disney classic and even the excellent 1934 MGM version.	0
A simple, sometimes insanely slow film that has just enough charm and good acting to make it interesting, but is ultimately swept away by the pace and lack of creativity inside.	0
Rob Mitchell, who has done a fine job directing Notting Hill in England, is too artistic in his American debut.	0
There is an almost poignant dimension to the way each great stunt gull plays its character.   The film is shot from behind, as if it could make us believe that we are not seeing a double.	0
Anthony Hopkins? Big deal! We have already seen the prequel to Silence of the Lambs and The Hannibal - and it was better the first time.	0
On the surface, it celebrates the power of middle-aged girls, even if it portrays friendship between women as pathetic, dysfunctional and damaging.	0
If this is an example of the kind of project Robert Redford's lab is willing to put its stamp on, then perhaps it's time to rethink independent films.	0
The pumpkin sits somewhere between listless Solondzien satire and quiet student film.	0
It's less funny than aggressively sitcom-sweet, full of throwaway one-liners, not-so-funny jokes and a determined TV loveability that everyone embodies.	0
It's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film, because it isn't. It's just incredibly boring.	0
The sad thing about the evaders is their lame attempt to capture the coolness vibes, when in reality the film is not as frivolous or smooth as it thinks.	0
A ponderous and clichéd film, smeared with every emotion known to man.	0
Director Ferzan Ozpetek creates an interesting dynamic with the members of this group who live in the same house. But he loses his focus when he focuses on one person.	0
Egoyan's film is too complicated to sustain participation, and, if you excuse a little critical heresy, too intellectually ambitious.	0
It wants to be seen as a subversive little indie film, but has all the qualities of a modern situation comedy.	0
Despite obvious motives to the contrary, the end, like [Seinfeld's] revered TV show, is about next to nothing.	0
Shadyac makes his film like a monkey Night Shyamalan film, and he often maintains the same snail's pace; he just forgot to add real tension.	0
plays less like a coming-of-age romance than a commercial.	0
There are a few laughs and clever gags, but not enough to make it more than another bust.	0
The story is so absurd that, despite the best efforts of all concerned, I did not believe it for a second.	0
I've heard that fans of the first men in black hate the second. I wonder why. They seemed like the same movie.	0
Despite their relentless vibes and sinuous facial symmetry, Witherspoon is simply too rolled up to be America's darling.	0
An indie debut with an extremely low budget, which corresponds to good intentions rather than talent.	0
Birot is a competent filmmaker, but her story has nothing fresh or exciting about it.	0
de niro and mcdormand give solid performances, but their screen time is sabotaged by the story's inability to spark interest.	0
Even single-digit age groups will see that this story is too stupid.   even for Disney.	0
That is essentially what the panels are missing - the sense of something bigger, of a crucial point.	0
A compendium of Solondz's worst instincts in under 90 minutes.	0
"If the title is a threat question, the answer might be: ""How does Steven Seagal get across these days?"" Or maybe ""how will you feel after an 88-minute demolition of the rock with action limited to slo-mo gunfire and random shards of glass?"	0
It's a comedy that's not very funny and an action movie that's not very exciting (and an unpleasant alliance, too).	0
The story is familiar from its many predecessors; like them, it culminates in the not-so-stunning realization that crimes don't pay.	0
You have more fun setting yourself alight in the parking lot. You will have more fun being caught by a bus.	0
Demonising a Bond film is like calling a dog stupid, but if it has the temerity to run for two hours, you feel like you're getting a kick.	0
Ritchie's handling of class reversal is largely hubristic, from the repetitive manifestos thrown in people's faces over and over again to the fact that Amber is such a joke.	0
Flat but with a revealing performance from Michelle Williams.	0
little more than a foaming vanity project	0
The film develops from an unusual science fiction character study to a chase movie that distracts from the end.	0
Verbinski replaces atmosphere with action, boredom with thrills	0
For all their superficial fury, high crimes should be accused of loitering - so much to see, so little to offer.	0
The sum total of all fears is hard to fathom - and there is something creepy about seeing an American football stadium as pop entertainment.	0
Alex Nohe's documentary plays like a travelogue for something that largely resembles a real, big-budget version of Tank Girls.	0
"The title ""Fallen"" turns out to be a fairly fair description of how you feel while watching this ultra-manipulative thriller."	0
The allure of vulgar, sexist, racist humour went over my head or - considering how low my forehead sits - it might sneak under my feet.	0
History really has no place because Simeone does not understand that it cannot deliver conflict.	0
There's not that much syrup.	0
For the most part, I was an amusing lark, which is probably one of Murphy's better performances in one of his less-lauded films.	0
"focuses on Joan's angry hormones and sledgehammers, which burden the audience with Spanish questions about her ""madness"" so much that I went mad that I wasted 123 minutes and 9 dollars. 50 on this 21st century torture device."	0
This series should have died a long time ago, but they keep bringing it back to another day as a punishment for paying money to see the last James Bond movie.	0
A bit bulky.	0
With a story as bizarre and mysterious as this one, you don't want to worry whether the ineffectual broom field will have the courage to knock on that door.	0
juggle and juggle three storylines, but fail to get to a convincing point, unless life stinks, especially for sensitive married women who love other women	0
The film feels great, and it feels like that for a long time to come, but it just never happens.	0
A gimmick in search of a movie: How to get Carvey into as many silly costumes and cast as many silly voices as possible, the plot mechanics cursed.	0
The last time I saw a theatre full of people constantly checking their clocks was during my Sats.	0
Fifty minutes of tedious adolescent melodrama followed by thirty-five minutes of inflated nonsense.	0
It lacks the punch and verve to elevate the genre.	0
"It's often mildly amusing, but the characters ""problems are never important to us, and the story never takes hold."	0
It's hard, astringent, darkly funny and.   Well, it's also general, messy, patronising and mild of the effects rather than stunning.	0
is largely an artifact for fans.	0
The detail of the artist's concepts and his ability to depict them with outrageous panache are undeniable, but in reality the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense, lavishly praised by those who equate darkness with depth.	0
Characters wander into predictably treacherous situations when they should know better.	0
Guillermo del Toro's sequel to the 1998 hit has plenty of style, but why do we need 117 minutes to tell a story that simply doesn't last more than 90 minutes?	0

No reason for anyone to invest their hard-earned money in a film that obviously hasn't invested much in itself.	0

It's more like watching a long soap opera where only the first episode was good.	0
It's fun, but a psychological mess, with austin forces knocking his head out on the way out.	0
There are touching moments in Etoiles, but for the most part this is a boring, sombre documentary about something that should be a joyous, or at least fascinating, subject.	0
Exaggerated, melodramatic bodice ripper	0
Could the whole plan have been here to produce something that, by comparison, makes it look like a classic? That is the only reasonable justification I can think of for the existence of a swimming fan.	0
I didn't laugh at the constant efforts of Dice and his skinny buddy mike epps to make like laurel and hardy'n the hood.	0

I wonder how the Israelis will react to this supposedly balanced presentation.	0
The film would work much better as a video installation in a museum where the audience could walk free. Immediately.	0
Human nature succeeds first by allowing itself to be driven mad, but ultimately fails by getting out of control.	0
[It's] a prison football movie with charismatic, tough guys, but it had too much spit for me to enjoy.	0
Not even the Hanson brothers can save it	0
The thriller side of this film falls flat because the stalker doesn't stalk much and no police officer or lawyer understands the concept of actually investigating.	0
[A] tense comedy that throws aside all opportunities for Rock to make his mark by serving up the usual chaotic nonsense.	0

It says more than it shows.	0
The seriousness of the situation lags behind his ideal predecessor, mainly due to Parker's unwise interference in the timeless source material.	0

A pretentious editing ruins a potentially terrific film.	0

Nothing devalues a conceptual comedy as much as grinding up bad ideas, and Showtime is full of them.	0
The long-awaited and lacklustre film.	0
It's just a different genre.	0
Each story in itself could have been expanded and turned into a compelling feature film, but in its current incarnation, storytelling never quite gets over its one-sided concept.	0
The only bright spot is William Bruchner as a pompous professor.	0
A banal psychological thriller, designed to keep the audience guessing and puzzling - not to be confused with suspicion - until it's time to finish things and send viewers home.	0
Neither funny nor exciting nor particularly drawn.	0
'Sometimes, when you're in a relationship and you're in a romance, it's hard not to feel sorry for yourself. '	0

"I kept thinking, ""I should enjoy this."" But I wasn't."	0
as from Mr. Schäffer, Christopher and Grazie are little more than a collection of quirky character traits that are ripped from the outlines of a screenwriter and thrown at actors charged with the impossible task of making them cry.	0
Like so many other supposedly scary films, it twists and turns in such a way that it drains energy from the very audience it is trying to scare.	0
The main problem in Orange County is that, having created an unusually lively set of characters worthy of its strong cast, the film stumbles when it comes to giving them something.	0
Just like Hearst's huge yacht, it is slow and bulky and takes a long time to reach its destination.	0
There is no character in the film with a glimmer of plausibility, no credible event, no confrontation that is not staged, no moment that is not false.	0
Where jokes from Cho's life story flowed most recently, offering a riveting dramaturgy, the comedian hides behind obviously constructed routines.	0
Why come up with anything remotely original when you can plunder from Shirley Jackson, Richard Matheson?   and puke something like pink?	0
A broad-based, offbeat comedy in which the actors deliver slightly amusing performances and no farm animals are hurt by the gags.	0
Too cruel to be a comedy, and too silly to be an effective horror film.	0
It lacks heart, depth and, above all, meaning.	0
Although a bit of a patchwork in script and production, a shiny, lush green setting almost makes the picture work.	0
absolutely pleasant, instantly memorable, nothing to write home about.	0
Wasabi is light fare, where the whole project feels like something is thrown away quickly (like one of Huber's hits), but popcorn should be smooth enough.	0

Kidman is really the only thing worth watching in Birthday Girl, a film by stage-trained Jez Butterworth (mojo), which is another example of the sad decline of British comedy in the post-Full Monty world.	0
Imagine if the character of James Woods from the videodrome were to make an Audrey Rose homeland movie and show it to the child from the sixth sense and you imagined the ring.	0
This time, the imagination left him.	0

The film, which is partly comedy, partly drama, achieves neither goal completely in the end and leaves us touched and amused by some moments and ideas, but still dissatisfied with the film overall.	0
Thank goodness boring film.	0
Bored, if not without wit, this shaggy dog longs to race through the alleys of history, but manages little more than a modest, slumbering charm.	0

It's a pretty awful film by conventional standards.   But it's also strangely fascinating, a pre-made Eurotrash cult object. Sometimes she moves strangely.	0

Wicked and sticky are the two best adjectives to describe ghost ship.	0
Some decent actors do great damage to their reputation.	0
As the great-grandson of the author, you'd think filmmaker Simon Brunnen had more respect for the material. But this expensive dud is a far cry from the book or the beloved movie.	0
Insulting in the way she exploits the explosive issue of domestic violence for cheap thrills and disgusts by repeatedly putting a young child in danger and treating her as little more than a prop who is cruelly tormented.	0

thoughtless, random, superficial humour and lots of very bad Scout accents	0

Accuracy and realism are great, but when the film gets boring and the dialogue is not clever, you have to use more poetic freedom.	0
For all its pompous titles and corkscrew narrative, the film turns out to be little more than a shaggy human story.	0
A soggy, clichéd horror epic even dumber than its title.	0
One groaning familiarity creates another.	0

never engaged, absolutely predictable and completely devoid of anything remotely interesting or exciting.	0
Marriage abuse is a big problem in today's society, but the film reduces this domestic tragedy to a flourishing melodrama.	0
oedekerk wrote Patch-Adams, which should not be forgiven. Why he had free rein over this project - he wrote, directed, acted and produced - is not clear.	0
The creaky, rusty ship provides a beautiful backdrop, but the spectre is routine.	0

Schmaltzy and unfunny, Adam Sandler's caricature of Hanukkah is stunningly bad, not very good, 10 worst list bad.	0
It really is another anaemic and formulaic buddy cop movie that tries to portray its lack of imagination as hip.	0

Morrissey's script and direction show a lot of intelligence and wit - but not much either.	0
There's a suspension of disbelief and then there's bad scripts.   In this film the latter is told.	0
All ms. Jovovich must look radiant, grimly purposeful and gently alarmed as a saintly heroine as he imposes doors, swings wrenches and flees monsters.	0

This is a particularly poisonous little candy that only a select few and very yellowish-haired taste.	0
This is not just the cliffnotes version of nicholas nickleby, it is the cliffnotes with missing pages.	0
Given the rough locations and demanding stunts, this must have been a difficult shoot, but the film also proved difficult for audiences.	0
Better sleep than a sound machine.	0
so clichéd that at one point they literally tip over an apple cart.	0
It is a decent insight into a time and an outcast who is no longer accessible, but does not necessarily shed more light on his subject than the popular predecessor.	0
It could be the first science fiction comedy to benefit from the laughs of a trio.	0
When the plot begins, the film loses credibility.	0
Credibility sinks into the swamp of emotions.	0
The film takes itself too seriously and as a result is only occasionally fun.	0
[davis] has a bright, choppy style that keeps things moving, while never quite managing to connect her wish-fulfilling characters with the human race.	0

Bullock's total lack of concentration and skill quickly derails the film	0
So stupid, so ill thought out, so poorly drawn, it created whole new levels of ugliness.	0
The truth is that the truth about Charlie is becoming increasingly tedious.	0
Permanent love, but exhausting cinema.	0
Some of Seagal's action images are guilty pleasures, but this one is so formulaic it seems to be on autopilot.	0
A ponderous meditation on love that feels considerably longer than its relatively paltry 97 minutes.	0
A long-winded and staged session of romantic invention that never really looks like the smart feminist fairy tale it could have been.	0
A bit too much for his good.	0
There are films that test even the most cinema-obsessed critic - and this was one of them.	0
Seeing trouble every day, at least if you don't know what's coming, is like biting into a juicy, delicious plum on a hot summer's day and getting away with a mouth full of rotten flesh and live worms.	0
As well-intentioned as she is, her soap opera morality stories have the antiseptic, pre-programmed feel of an extracurricular special.	0
What would Jesus do if he were a director? He would make a movie better than this.	0
If it turns out that a series of guidelines that a director has devised for his actors before shooting is smarter, better written and of considerable interest than the finished film, that is a bad sign. A very bad sign.	0
It is a deeply serious film, passionately interested in its subject, but all too often it becomes ponderous in its teaching of history or gets lost in the complicated connections and complex timelines of its story.	0
cannot upset the gathered talent and the Russos show real promise as comic filmmakers. Still, this thing feels flimsy and fleeting.	0
Diane Lane is unfaithful. Almost everything else is nonsense.	0
I'm afraid you won't get over this frankly fantastic By the Numbers B flick with a degree of disbelief. Instead, wrestle to the ground in disbelief and then apply the handkerchief soaked in chloroform.	0
so ruthlessly healthy that I wanted to delete something.	0
The title offers the most concise review you'll read anywhere.	0
The makers of the divine secrets of the Ya-ya Sisterhood should offer a free ticket (second prize, of course, two free tickets) to anyone who can find a truly honest moment in their film.	0
God help the poor woman when Attal is so insecure in real life: the neuroses of his fictional Yvan are sufficiently aggravating to exhaust the patience of even the most understanding husband.	0
Let's get back to the conclusion of the Consumer Advice Service: stay at home.	0
Undercover brother doesn't go far enough. It's just a silly black parody.	0
The implicit premise of the film is that the faith of the Tonga people is inferior to John's in every way.	0
"An ""e"" stands for effort - and a ""b"" for boredom."	0
You've seen heartbreak when you've seen the vastly superior Nurse Betty or the Boulevard of Sunset. Even the uncontrollable soap dish is more original.	0

A journey too random and inconclusive to be convincing, but one that makes Hoffman's brilliance almost worth it.	0
The film bounces off the map.	0
"But with bogus truths and routine ""indie"" filmmaking, he has made another sure film. It's not terrible, just terribly mediocre."	0
This strange mixture of crime fiction, quirky character study, third-rate romance and female empowerment fantasy never really finds the sound or thematic glue it needs.	0
"""Juwanna man?"" No thanks. We want our money back."	0
It's a sometimes interesting remake that doesn't compare to the brilliant original.	0
They are too aware of the effort needed to be so spontaneous.	0
Simple.	0
I feel bad for King, who's trying honestly, and Schwartzman, who's shooting himself in the foot.	0
Some actors steal scenes. Tom Green just gives them a bad smell. This self-absorbed do-gooder is far from the only thing wrong with the heavy-handed comedy that steals the show, but he is the most obvious.	0
Sometimes fond memories should remain in the past: a lesson this film teaches all too well.	0
The enormous comic potential of an oafish idiot embodying an aristocrat is sadly unrecognised.	0
Flat.	0
begins as a promising meditation on one of America's most enduring obsessions, but ends as a slim cinematic stunt	0
A monster fighting thriller as impersonal in its relentlessness as the video game series that inspired it.	0
Proof that a thriller can be elegantly shot, skillfully cast and crisp professionalism.   and would still be a disappointment if their twists and turns were not more surprising than yesterday's weather forecast.	0
The reason we see the same movie every year with about the same people is because so many of us carry on and then, out of shame or stupidity, warn no one.	0
There's not much going on in this film, unless you just decide to accept the notion that something inexplicably strange has happened.	0
In the second half of the film Frei loses control in direct relation to the time he gives to self-analysis.	0
"Director Barry Skolnick and his screenwriters tick every point of the ""longest yard"" like a checklist."	0
The furious coherence that [deniro] brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the film itself, which, as it drifts toward the end, feels less like a film than like a filmed reading of a script that needs tweaking.	0
Oh, that's extreme, okay. Extremely stupid. Extremely confusing. Extremely boring.	0
We never really feel connected to history, because all its ideas remain exactly that: abstract ideas.	0
"For a shooting ""em-up, ballistic is strangely lifeless."	0
One minute you're looking at a serious action player; the next, it's as if clips of the Pink Panther have been spliced back in.	0
What happened to Pluto Nash? How was it ever made?	0
We may never see Bandcamp as something geeky or nerdy again.	0
"The film begins as promising as any war / adventure film you'll ever see, and dissolves into a routine court drama that lends itself better to a film called ""Glory: A Soldier's Story."""	0
The result is solemn and terrifying, but strangely aloof.	0
These spiders can run off a motorcycle in seconds and wrap a person in a sticky cocoon, but they are neither interesting nor entertaining.	0
A less thrilling thriller.	0
A long gaffe for everyone but the most dedicated Pokemon fan.	0
matthew mcconaughey tries and fails to control the screen with swaggering machismo and exaggerated madness.	0
How on earth did director Ron Underwood manage to spend $100 million on it?	0
Everyone associated with this film seems to be part of an insider clique that tends to produce formulaic rather than fresh films.	0
With a story inspired by the turbulent environment of Los Angeles, where every dreamer with a burst bubble has feelings of marginalization, the dog handler has a few characters and ideas, but he never manages to get them the same way.	0
His lack of quality earns him a place alongside the other two Dumas botched jobs of recent times, the man with the iron mask and the musketeer	0
a harmless but unforgettable science fiction variety.	0
The plot grinds to a halt with a yawning, boring smile.	0
It's never a good sign when the movie star spends the entire movie in a coma. It's a worse sign when you start to envy her condition.	0
It doesn't help that director and cinematographer Jasmierski shot on grunting video, which gives the whole thing a dirty, tasteless feel.	0
Desperately unfunny when he tries to make us laugh, and desperately unexciting when he tries to jump us from our seats.	0
The film's relationship to actual tension is the same as that of a Christmas tree floating in a spray can to actual snow: a bad - albeit permanent - imitation.	0
John McEnroe's botched remake may be subtler than Norman Jewison's ultra-violent 1975 futuristic corporate sports saga It's also stupid.	0
Director Richard Shafer and co-writer Greg Hinton ride the dubious dividing line where gay porn reaches for serious drama.	0
borrows from so many literary and cinematic sources that this future world feels an absolute déjà vu.	0
The more depressing [the characters] become, the more tiring the story becomes, especially as it continues to strive strikingly to be profound.	0
The acting of the over 25s lacks the spark, with the Csokas particularly disconnected.	0
Although Howard is a great director, this southern gothic drama is unfortunately a hard sell, with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and clumsy metaphors to suffocate a horse - or at least slow it down to a canter.	0
is shaken when it takes itself too seriously and when it depends too much on its otherwise talented cast to become a clown in situations that are not funny.	0
The fight scenes are fun, but it gets boring.	0
Anyone who can count to five (target audience of the film?) can see where this stupid brew is going.	0
None of this turns out to be funny or provocative - just boring.	0
Demme's relaxed approach kills the tension.	0
This idea has lost its originality.   And neither star seems particularly excited about it, which was basically a joke.	0
[Plays] roughly as a middle-aged buddy comedy	0
The film itself is a kind of cinematic high crime, one that keeps the dramas in military courts very, very low.	0
Nothing more than a mediocre little thing.	0
A sultry little history lesson, humourless and boring.	0
Too stupid to be scared, too stoic to be funny, it projects the same lazy affability as its star, David Cameron.	0
If Cameron Diaz were kept in a cage with her monkey, he would mate her in his latest case.	0
Trivial where it should be profound and hyper-clichéd where it should be honest.	0
It would be hard to imagine a new movie that has worked so hard to achieve this little fun.	0
Why put someone who ultimately doesn't learn at the center of a children's story?	0
All the (Powerpuff girls) charm is there in the movie, but it's too thin.	0
sometimes clever, but often secondary	0
The ill-conceived modern ending falls flat where it should deliver a moral punch.	0
Collateral damage, despite its alleged provocation after 9 / 11, is ultimately a matter of history. As well as his star, attitude and forgetfulness.	0
It hesitates and drags when it should bang; it does not even have the virtue of brainless violence to break the boredom of all its generational connections.	0
His message of saving the planet clashes with his crass marketing.	0
a great idea becomes a not great movie	0
This film almost provoked me to take my own life. And if the Oscars win best picture, I could.	0
In the end I was looking for something heavy to beat myself with.	0
Not a film, but an agitprop cartoon in live action, so shameless and crude that it is almost comic.	0
It feels like six different films fighting for attention.	0
Life is a pot - or something like that.	0
by jackasses for jackasses.	0
Despite a powerful performance by Binoche, it is a period romance that suffers from an exaggerated tempo and an uneven narrative dynamic.	0
The picture is a guide to what happens when a lack of know-how mixes with a lack of skill.	0
Bartleby is a one-off, and a bad joke.	0
Parody in dissolution.	0
Given that both films expect us to stand up for convicted violent criminals against those who are supposed to protect us from them, we need every ounce of compassion that can muster the disadvantages; this time, not much.	0
A bravura exercise in the void.	0
Tail must spin in his grave, along with my stomach.	0
despite the premise of a good story.   She squanders all her star power on clichéd or meaningless roles.	0
All prints of this film should be sent to Pluto and buried.	0
The film not only does not make us part of its reality, but also the most basic relevance test.	0
First good, then annoying. Outstanding Acting Performance and Direction.	0
This silly gangster yarn never really stands out from being another serious generic crime-fighting vehicle - a well-intentioned remake that shows some spunk and promise, but doesn't register as something distinctive or bold	0
It's hard to say whether the tuxedo is more boring or more embarrassing - I'm prepared to call it a draw.	0
Even if lame horror movies go, it's lame.	0
so routine, familiar and predictable that it raises the possibility that it has written itself as a newly automated computer program.	0
The Sunshine State lacks the kind of momentum that Limbo offers, and in some ways it is a rather indulgent piece.	0
even legends like alfred hitchcock and john huston staged occasional pettiness.   So it is no surprise to see a world-class filmmaker like Zhang Yimou behind the camera working for a yarn that is ultimately irrelevant.	0
a long-winded, predictable scenario.	0
Too close to the phantom threat for comfort.	0
Silly humbuggie.	0
Although trying to reconcile self-referential humor and a normal ol'slasher plot might seem like a decent endeavor, the result satisfies neither die-hard Jason fans nor those who understand good jokes.	0
Too clunky and too busy to be really entertaining.	0
This film is about lying, cheating, but loving the friends you betray.	0
It smacks of purely commercial motivation, without much love for the original.	0
Melanie eventually engulfs the Yankee. It's just a shame the former Murphy Brown doesn't resurface.	0
at the bottom of the row.	0
a real clown. a well-made, well-thought-out, well-acting clunker, but still a clunker.	0
A dismal rip-off of Goodfellas that serves as a muddled and offensive warning to Hispanic Americans.	0
The picture, which is occupied by a perversely cheerful Marcus Müller accordion / harmonica / banjo atrocity, is a monument to evil in all its flourishing diversity.	0
"Good for a few unintentional laughs, ""extreme ops"" was obviously made for the ""xxx"" crowd, people who enjoy pointless action without the benefit of decent acting, writing and directing."	0
A big, baggy, sprawling carnival of a film that spreads before us without rhyme or reason.	0
a frustrating combination of tense humour and heavy-handed sentimentality	0
The law strictly preaches to converts.	0
as written by michael berg and michael j. From a story by wilson, this relentless, all-wise guys-all-time approach tries far too much and becomes tiring in no time.	0
will probably remain in the shadow of his two older, more accessible Qatsi siblings.	0
Just when the film seems confident enough to deal with subtlety, it plunges into soapy baths.	0
Choppy editing and too many repetitive scenes spoil what could have been an important documentary about stand-up comedy.	0
The film uses the same old formula of teen sex, outrageous pranks and scenes designed to make people laugh.	0
The only thing you haven't seen in Pauline and Paulette is a scene with a football-sized oriental rug made of millions of live flowers.	0
If you're looking for comedy, look elsewhere.	0
It effectively defines a comedy that is strongly mediocre and in which funny details occasionally emerge.	0
Immediately nominated for worst film of the year	0

like a tone deaf singer at a charity concert, john q. is a bad film that runs for a good cause.	0

What is recorded during the conceptual process is not a sufficient explanation of what the last dance work, the selection, became in its final form.	0

The plot is so predictable and sentimental that viewers are likely to lose interest before Sandrine and her goats set off into the sunset.	0
The sight of a blind man directing a film is hilarious at first, but as the film progresses, the joke thins.	0

If you lower your expectations to an all-time low, you could do worse than this strangely jolly - but not particularly funny - body-changing farce.	0
The episodic film makes a valid case for the depersonalisation of modern life. But the characters tend to be clichés whose lives are never fully explored.	0
Serry succeeds brilliantly in capturing the climate of the time and, perhaps unconsciously, connecting it with what happened in America in 2002. But it's hard to believe that the twists and turns of the plot derail the film in its final half hour.	0

Another big, silly action movie in the style of xxx, the van is riddled with plot holes big enough for its titular hero to drive his sleek black BMW.	0

The film becomes mute and routine.	0
The question of faith is not studied very intensively	0

It's poorly acted, bluntly staged and could have been written by someone who has just finished primary school.	0
The white oleander is not, after all, a novel adaptation. It's a shrill, star-shaped reduction.	0

The timid, affluent, indulgent characters are crunchy rather than engaging.	0
a soggy, shapeless mess.   Just a silly excuse for an equivalent of a ghost movie.	0

A mysterious misfire and possibly the weakest film [Woody Allen] has made in the last 20 years.	0
It won't be long before you spy on me in a video store near you.	0
This film looks like it was produced in 1954, put on hold for 48 years and packaged for an audience in 2002.	0
Not through figures, but through caricatures.	0
The entire production does not contain an ounce of honesty.	0
This extremely unfunny film lasts 80 minutes, but feels twice as long.	0
Serious, but grounded.   A slow, muddy, soporific, visually arresting crime melodrama / character study that would be more at home on the small screen, but for its outstanding cast.	0
The plot is so ripe that the film can't help but become soft and smelly.	0
For all his supposed youthful fire, Xxx is no less submissive to Bond's tired formula of guns, girls and gadgets as he brandishes a new action hero.	0
a predictable and stereotypically small B-movie.	0
If I were spies funny (enough) or exciting (enough), it would be quite easy to forgive the financial blackmail they are trying to get from the public.	0
Frustratingly, dridi tells us nothing about el gallo, except what his music creates.	0
places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult-to-swallow setting and then disappointingly puts the story in the realm of an incredible thriller.	0
Stephanie Earnhart's documentary is a decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition in the guise of unsentimental, straightforward writing, when in reality it is an exercise in gross romanticisation of delusional personality	0
a very average science fiction film.	0

The kind of film that gives tasteless a bad rap.	0
The cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the film itself, which contains little laughter and little drama.	0
The plot is off the rails, the performances are televised and the message of consolation through deception is a bit creepy.	0
Ordinary melodrama weighing heavily on religious symbols but wafer-thin on dramatic substance	0

Jolie's appearance disappears somewhere between her hair and lips.	0

static, repetitive, slushy and blurry, hey arnold! The title of the ugliest film of the year seems to be fixed.	0
For all the post-colonial consciousness of the present that Kapur tries to convey to the four feathers, the strangest thing about the film is how it ultimately confirms the same damned, moldy values that were always at the heart of the material.	0
un thriller manqué qui tombe sur les nerfs presque dès la première image.	0
When it comes to entertainment, children earn more than Pokemon Go.	0
What the four feathers lack is real momentum or feeling, or even a character worth considering.	0
While Good-natured people (who are stars and co-writers) seem to be having a wonderful time, he may be alone.	0
Yes, 4ever is harmless in the extreme and will keep your children silent for almost 80 minutes, but why not just treat the little yard monkeys to the real deal and take them away?	0
The grotesque and boring son is peppered with unintentional laughter, which unfortunately happens too rarely to make the film even a guilty pleasure.	0
Calling this film brainless would be a compliment: it's more entertainment for trolls.	0
None of these characters resembles anyone you've ever met in real life, unless you know annoyingly headstrong people who speak in plain sentences that can only be penned by a screenwriter.	0
It's just a big mess of a film full of images and events, but no suspense or surprise.	0
As elegant as it is often designed, Anderson's film is essentially a one-trick pony that, hampered by an undeveloped script, ultimately lags.	0

has virtually no script at all.	0
will satisfy only those who do not distinguish between the good, the bad and the ugly.	0
This kind of dark comedy requires a delicate, surgical touch. But director Danny DeVito and screenwriter Adam Resnick (remember Cabin Boy?) Pounds off.	0
But sometimes Dogtown and Z-boys lapse into an insider language and mentality that the uninitiated find hard to follow or care about.	0
The film quickly lapses into a soothing formula of brotherly conflict and reconciliation.	0

Most of the approaches are incoherent.	0
Liman, of Swingers and Go, makes his big-budget action film debut as something of a fool's errand as he delivers a long, low-heat chase punctuated by a mid-chase.	0
Surprisingly lazy for a film in which the main character travels back and forth between eras.	0
The problem is not that the film strikes so close to home, but that it strikes so close to home, while engaging in idiocies like this snake-bite business and the inevitable shot of Schwarzenegger passing a fireball.	0

Shocking only because it reveals the filmmaker's abyss of self-absorption.	0
This talk of faith, hope and charity does little to offend, but if sugary seriousness were a crime, the film's producers would be jailed for life.	0
The whole thing ends well, but the crazy moments never click.	0

The film really isn't as bad as it sounds.	0
The central story lacks punch.	0

What was subtle and mysterious in the novel is now comprehensive and absurd.	0
Children often seem to read the lines and are unable to convey emotions.	0

This 72-minute film has some thrilling scenes, but it's a bit slow.	0
Although supertroops are above academy standards, their quintet of writers might still need some education.	0
This ruinous reissue, a mixture of speed and idiocy, lacks the power - and brain - of the 1970s original.	0
The low-budget full-front film was one of the darkest, deliberately obscure and revelatory images of the year, and solaris is its big-budget brother.	0
The plot is very clever, but Boyd burdens it with too many characters and events, all intertwined and far too complicated to follow.	0

Although it is obviously an extremely personal work, it remains inextricably entangled in an emotionally inaccessible mess.	0

A beautiful, sleepless show, beautifully mummified and thoroughly unsurprising.	0
A semi-autobiographical film so sloppily written and cast that you can't believe anyone is more central to the production of bugs than the caterer.	0
It feels like a collaborative theatre production of a great play: even at its best, it will never hold a candle to the original.	0
The film apparently takes place in a fantasy world, where people recite poetry in hotel corridors instead of talking to each other.	0
The element of surprise is perhaps the only thing femme fatale has.	0
It's the kind of film that you can't really recommend because it's just a distraction and doesn't offer much scope, but you can't bring yourself to reject it.	0
Maybe it's asking too much, but if a film is to really inspire me, I want a bit more.	0
A graceful, mindless attempt to combine some things with the spy thriller.	0
The plot and characters are nowhere near gripping enough.	0
The film is based on a david leavitt story and shares the usual mix of observational wisdom, superficial coincidence and slightly damaging preciousness.	0
Like any gull movie, just louder and without that silly ponytail.	0
To enjoy the sharp dialogue and delightful performance by Jolie and Burns, you have to overplay the pointless ending.	0
National Lampoon's van could be the worst thing to come out of the national Lampoon since unification	0
This is a great subject for a film, but Hollywood has wasted the opportunity and used it as a prop for warmed-up melodrama and the kind of choreographed chaos on which director john woo built his career.	0
Leave this one off your list.	0
Overall, the film falls far short of Jelinek's novel's brilliance. It is content to be gloomy.	0
the errors remain intact, but the fictional footage is unconvincing and criminally badly acted.	0
It's not the thirsty, consuming passion that drives this film. No, it is the repetition of this behaviour, and therefore the children of the century are more mindless love than mad, crunchy and boring than anything.	0
Just because it really happened to you doesn't mean it's interesting to anyone.	0
Just like the deli sandwich: lots of ham, lots of cheese, with a sickly sweet shell to hide its excesses until just after (or during) the second half.	0
Again and again, a film comes along that confirms the worst fears of civilisation as we know it. The new one is one of them.	0

If this film belonged to a sorority, it would be called Beta Alpha Delta	0
Not a cheap slasher film, as the material would suggest, but a bit like a nature film showing a patient predator and his foolish prey.	0
Uncomfortable confusion of styles and genres	0
Herzog is obviously looking for a morality to his fable, but the idea that a strong, unified presence among German and Eastern European Jews might have changed 20th-century history is undermined by his underachievement.	0
All in all, there is only one thing to fight: expulsion.	0
beyond a handful of mildly amusing lines.   There's just not much to laugh about.	0
Secret ballot is too reflective to be really funny.	0
The center of the film will not hold.	0
The Myers never know when to let a gag die, so we are exposed to one insanely long riff on poo and pee jokes after another.	0
Too lazy to use its semi-humorous premise.	0
a great ending doesn't make up for a weak movie, and Crazy as hell doesn't even have a great ending.	0
Dialogue-heavy and too cerebral for his own good - or at least too cerebral for his fast-paced subject.	0
Its excessive reliance on genre conventions, character types, and formulaic conflict resolution crushes any goodwill it might otherwise develop.	0

None of this fits.	0
"Since it abruptly crosses between the five friends, he fails to lend enough dramatic resonance to the characters ""individual stories for us to take care of."	0
Somehow, we are supposed to buy into the idea that this spendthrift mother avoids her children, travels to one of the most dangerous parts of the world, never gets tired and never gets tired.  Jane.	0
The cast is so weak that none of the characters get that big.   and the setting remains unclear.	0
Consider the chunk on the title's leg that suggests someone has worked overtime to develop an irritatingly unimaginative retread.	0
The film quickly drags on, becoming boring and predictable. I tried to read the time on my watch.	0
The film makes a tragic mistake by going on too long, trying to mirror every other event in Chinese history: war, revolution, communism etc.	0
In his first film, johnson has set himself a task he is nowhere near equal to.	0
"Ultimately, the project seems clinical, detached, uninvolved, which may lead viewers to ask: ""What's the point?"""	0
The two main characters are almost good enough to camouflage the dark plot, but so much naturalistic small talk, delivered in almost muted exchanges, ultimately has a drowning effect.	0
The film meant well with its fairy tale about freedom, but could not reach the heart because it was too bossy.	0
The film is as fast as it can get to the point where it almost halts the flow of blood to the brain; it has a boring costume sense.	0
Once the audience has figured out what is being said, the filmmaker's relative passivity will make it difficult for them to really care.	0
There is nothing provocative about this film except the way it studiously avoids making you think.	0
It seems to be just a long, tangled trick to get men to move - no less.	0
The premise for this Kegger comedy may have sounded brilliant like a six-pack and a jug of margarita in it, but the film must be written.   in the crush of a malicious hangover.	0
Even by stupid action movie standards, the following applies: It's a silly action movie.	0
The cinematic equivalent of a toy box, the contents of which are spread over 80 minutes.	0
Just bloody chaos.	0
Creepy but ultimately unsatisfactory thriller.	0

They would do better to invest in the worthy Emi recording that serves as the soundtrack, or in the home video of the 1992 Malfitano Domingo production.	0

"Bears are bad. Not ""terrible filmmaking"" bad, but rather: ""I once had a nightmare like this, and now it's coming true."""	0
As is so often the case with projects such as lofty and lofty ambitions, the film is less poetic than simply pretentious.	0
George, please hire a real director and good writers for the next part.	0
For a film about two disparate pals, Crystal and De Niro share little screen time and even less chemistry.	0
As skillful as Nelson was in providing variety within the confines of its structure and staging, the question remains whether this really should have been presented as a theatrical publication.	0
Extreme Ups - Oops, Oops, no matter how you spell it, it's still a mistake to see.	0
What could and should have been snappy and droll is instead a lukewarm waste of time and talent.	0

Admirable, certainly, but not particularly funny to watch. only for cocaine lovers.	0
a mess of a film - visually unattractive, unbearably loud and utterly silly.   His hilarity is entirely unintentional.	0
De Niro could enjoy the same free ride from critics that Clint Eastwood did in the lazy Blood. But like Bruce Springsteen's poached Asbury Park, this sad dead end of a film is a ruined city.	0
No, it's not nearly as good as all his influences.	0
A reasonably efficient mechanism, but one that offers few surprises and sees its stars slumbering in areas they should have avoided.	0
The rest of the plot is inexplicable without blowing away any tension, although it is more comic than tension that de palma creates.	0
Human nature speaks the talk, but it fails to walk the silly walk that distinguishes the quirky from the surreal.	0
The seaside town is the cinematic equivalent of defensive driving: it is careful, conscientious and makes no big mistakes. But what saves lives on the highway is not necessarily convincing.	0
The Marquis de sade could not have been as boring as this film makes him seem.	0
What could have been a pretty little story about faith in oneself is swamped by ponderous melodrama.	0
The cast is equally excellent.   But the film itself is only slightly charming.	0
Drives the same kind of bittersweet, conciliatory tone that has reached three seasons but is drowned in rhetorical excess and overt sentimentality.	0
A bigger downer than your end-of-year bill.	0
The whole thing plays with the sleepy heaviness of a synchronized swimmer in a woolly suit.	0
Pretty successful in feigning some pretty cool stunts, but a complete failure to create some pretty cool characters. and forget about any attempt at conspiracy!	0

Safe conduct, however ambitious and well-intentioned, does not hit the mark.	0
My reaction to the film is best described as lukewarm. Perhaps I found the process a little too conventional.	0

It is too long, too repetitive and takes far too many years to decide to be a total winner.	0
A fuzzy warning.	0
"A film that tries to merge the two ""forests,"" but ends up with a clumsy, hollow masala mess."	0
Judge! Wedge and Lord Saldanha understands the mix of puns and slapstick well. However, her film falters in its adherence to the Disney philosophy of sharpness, a greeting the film would hopefully avoid.	0

It's more like a long visit from a large group of relatives. As your relatives swap banal stories after banal one, you start to wonder if they will ever leave.	0
Unfortunately, as a writer, Montias is not nearly as good for his team as he is as a director or actor.	0

You'd better stay home and watch the x files.	0
It's messy, smug and remarkably ugly to look at.   like a series of apparently terrible student films that were put together into a full-length horror.	0

reggio succumbs to the temptation to rely on the very digital technology he passionately despises, creating a meandering, inarticulate and ultimately disappointing film	0
The film makes absolutely no sense. The underlying mythology is a hotchpotch of contradictions that raises the question: Since when does stupid entertainment have to be so stupid?	0
The problem with this film is that it is forced to turn its characters into idiots to advance the plot. If anyone had done anything remotely intelligent here, we could all have stopped watching.	0
Despite the authenticity of the insignia, the film is overdone in its plot, hackneyed in its dialogue and anachronistic in style.	0
Murder and mayhem of this kind quickly become monotonous.	0
the journey to redemption feels more like a cinematic experiment than a full-blown film.	0

The interviews tend to get the boys off the hook.	0
The streets shot by cinematographer Michael Ballhaus may be as authentic as they are mean, but it's almost impossible to care what happens on them.	0
This is a good film in a nutshell, but if it doesn't work, it's at important times.	0
Parker probably thinks he's shaking up a classic, like Kenneth Branagh and Baz Luhrmann, but this half-hearted mess still leaves us missing Wilde's contemporary play.	0

Sometimes entangled, it lapses into the absurd rather casually.	0
All these developments and challenges that Santa Claus faces weigh so heavily on the plot that they drain all the film's energy and unnecessarily strain its credibility.	0
Anaemic, pretentious.	0
There is a strange resonance here between the actor and the role, which is not exactly flattering.	0

It's a serious debut full of hearty performances, but ultimately disappointed by an all-too-predictable story.	0
About as innovative as pet rock: the film.	0
With generic sets and B-grade special effects, Jason is about as convincing on the sci-fi front as the late Cleopatra on TV.	0
is not sweet enough to revive its predictable history and will bitterly disappoint even hip hop fans.	0

Christians sensitive to a reductionist view of their Lord as a lustful Dr. Feel-good or almighty carelessness people will feel infinitely more offended than secularists, who might even praise God for delivering such an instant camp classic.	0

What is at stake in this film is nothing more than an obsolete, if irritating, notion of class.	0

Gooding and Coburn are both Oscar winners, a fact that seems inconceivable when you watch them awkwardly fighting their way through snow dogs.	0

The children in the audience at the performance seemed bored and cheered the performances, but little else; their parents, clever people who are them, read books.	0
Whether Jason x is deliberately so bad is never clear. But one thing is certain: it's neither funny nor scary.	0
Another weeping Southerner.	0
I like all four main actors very much and they manage to squeeze a few laughs out of the material, but at best they tread water in this memorable effort.	0
Perhaps the most annoying thing about Cletis is who he is? is that it is a crime film by someone who obviously knows nothing about crime.	0
Except as an acting exercise or as an extraordinarily dark joke, one wonders what anyone saw in this film that made it possible to make it.	0
This unbearable film is meant to make us think about existential suffering. Instead, you fall asleep.	0

It's so tiring that you can forgive every false, dishonest, entertaining and ultimately perceptible moment in Bridget Jones's Diary.	0

The gifted blank has the perfect face to play a beautiful, empty longing for himself, and his coded personality and bad behavior would work well if the film knew what to do with him.	0
It's depressing, ruthlessly painful and depraved, the cinematic equivalent of looking into an open wound.	0
Clumsy, dull soap opera disguised as a feature film	0
Cold, pretentious, thoroughly unpleasant study of sociopathy	0

Human nature is a goofball movie, as Malkovich was, but he tries too much.	0
Originality is sorely lacking.	0
The distinctly mythical structure of the plot may be due more to Disney's strong sense of formula than the original story. But while the highly predictable narrative falls short, the treasure planet is truly beautiful to watch.	0
Although there are entertaining and daring moments, the film's wildly carefree tone and extremely flat lead do little to save the filmmaker's battered reputation.	0
An example of the overlooked pitfalls of such an undertaking is the young documentary maker.	0

What we have is a character facing the possibility that her life is meaningless, vague and devoid of substance in a film that is definitely meaningless, vague and without substance.	0
nothing more than a suffocating moral story in pectoral clothing.	0
I like my Christmas movies with more elves and snow and less pimps and ho's.	0
Everything seemed to be wasted like Deniro's once promising career and the once great long seafront.	0
[I] t certainly commendable that the film deals with hot-blooded issues in a comedic context, but it's not as funny as it should be.	0

Cox offers many insights into existing photographs, but there are no films by Nijinsky, so the director gives us an aimless mess instead.	0
Every note sounds wrong.	0
When the screenwriter responsible for one of the worst films of the year directs an equally miserable film the following year, it is hard to believe it was just coincidence.	0

Admirably ambitious but smug.	0
This story of unrequited love finds no interest beyond the first half hour.	0
This fear-ridden territory was covered earlier and much better by ordinary people.	0
The whole movie is a great excuse to play one lewd scene after another. About half of them are funny, some are sexy and none are useful to tell the story, which is gossamer-thin and downright unoriginal.	0

Rubbing and boredom.	0

interesting and thoroughly unfaithful version of Carmen	0
A serious film with serious ideas. But seriously, folks, it doesn't work.	0
There is nothing exactly wrong here, but it is not nearly enough right.	0
The plot is unusually tame, the characters are too simplistic to keep the interest going, and the plot offers little surprise.	0
I couldn't help but feel the wasted potential of this slapstick comedy.	0
What Madonna is doing here cannot really be called acting - more precisely, it moves and it speaks and gestures occasionally, sometimes at once.	0
[A] painfully flat, crass comedy	0
Even if you are an Elvis person, you will not find anything on this DVD to get excited about.	0
The film certainly has its share of clever moments and snappy dialogue, but there's not much lurking beneath its abstract surface.	0
It is marred by tedious writing and lax direction.	0
I'm sure there's a teenager out there who dies for that kind of entertainment.	0
The tuxedo miscalculates badly, forcing the star to play second fiddle to the boring effects that bring the suit to life.	0
The film is a confusing mélange of tones and styles, one moment a romantic trifle and the next a turbulent drama.	0
Obviously, many people (including me) wasted a lot of their time on something very trivial.	0
There is a little violence and a lot of sex to attract our attention, but after a while it becomes monotonous, as do John and Philip's repetitive arguments, intrigue and betrayal.	0
She drowns in juice.	0
Consciously and devotedly constructed, it is too postcard perfect, too neat and pin-shaped, too obviously a reproduction to resonate.	0
Rarely can a film be as intelligent in every way as this one, except in its plot; all that is good is ultimately undone by an action that is simply too boring and obvious.	0
I give it thumbs down because of the endlessly repeated scenes of embarrassment. There must be a more graceful way of depicting the devastation of this disease.	0
The good - the only good - about extreme ops is that it's so nonsensical that it gave me plenty of time to rethink my thank-you to-do list.	0
The modern characters are nowhere near as vibrant as those of the 19th century.	0
The film, blessed with a glowing lead role from Ryan Gosling (Murder by Numbers), is powerful and provocative. It also builds on a flawed premise, which it follows in melodrama and silliness.	0
Irregular performances and a spotty script make for a biting satire without teeth.	0
Director Jay Russell stomps on Natalie Babbitt's gentle, endearing 1975 children's novel.	0
Benigni's Pinocchio is extremely straightforward and witty, its episodic pace keeping the film from developing a narrative flow.	0
The disturbing thing about watch stoppers is that they make no sense.	0

Material and production itself are little more than routine.	0
But the film's biggest and most devastating mistake is its reliance on the formula, and that is enough to diminish the film's overall impact.	0

Besenfeld's journalistic style is hardly journalism, and even those who are passionate about the subject grow impatient.	0

A series of escapades demonstrating the saying that what is good for the goose is good for the crook, some of which are occasionally amused but do not tell a great story.	0
It offers a helpful subtext, ignores the reality of gay sex and presents another tired old vision of the gay community as an all-encompassing world in which cramped middle-class bores like Antonia can feel comfortable.	0

Writer / director Burr manages the q in bizarre ways, with mixed results.	0

hypnotically dull, relentlessly depressed, ridiculously predictable to the beat of the suicidal poetry of a depressed 15-year-old	0
The concept is a hit. The trailer is a riot. The film is a dud.	0
It is a boring film about a boring man, made visible by a brilliant performance by a consummate actor incapable of being boring.	0
Since the level of intelligence of the characters has to be low, very low, very low for the masquerade to work, the film contains no jokes, only laborious gags.	0
It's hard to imagine another director ever making his wife look so bad in a big film.	0
Some stunning pictures - and some amazingly boring movies.	0
These characters are getting tired.	0
A hickhack affair, thoroughly amusing, but not as outrageous or funny as Cho might have intended or as imaginative as one might have hoped.	0
This could be the first ever cartoon that looks like it's being shown on a sports bar screen.	0
kim ki-deok seems to have in mind (emotionally at least) a young audience that regularly demands shocks and bouts of barely justifiable sexual violence in order to maintain interest.	0
a first class film - a cross between boys not crying, redemption and ode to billy joe - lies somewhere in the story of Matthew Shepard, but this film is yet to be made.	0
Having read this sloppy comedy special, conceived for the film, I wonder if Lawlessness hates criticism so much that it refuses to rate its own work.	0
It's a mix of clichés.	0
Many shallower films these days seem too long, but this one is tremendously short.	0
Only a kiss is bound to emerge as an imaginative film about the typical problems of average people. But it's set in a world that's very, very far removed from where most of us live.	0
The worst-conceived animated comedy since the 1991 Dog Rover disaster.	0
Like shaving ice without a coating, this mound of cinematic snow is as harmless as it is tasteless.	0
"Despite its sincere acting, ""Signs"" is just another unoriginal sequel to the sci-fi film with a flimsy ending and much hype."	0
Another film that assumes that the social groups of high schools are at war, let alone aware of their existence.	0

I can't remember the last time I saw an audience laugh so much during a movie, but there's only one problem that's supposed to be a drama.	0
Properties that were once amusing are now irritating.	0
Well, Jason has gone to Manhattan and hell, I guess a space station in the year 2455 can be removed from the idea list for the inevitable future sequels (hey, don't shoot the messenger).	0
Donovan.   wastes its most important asset, jackie chan, and screws up vital plot lines.	0
There is no psychology or real narrative logic here - just a series of carefully choreographed atrocities that become strangely impersonal and abstract.	0
Bread, my candy has so many flaws that it would be easy for critics to crush it. It could even fall into the category of films you love so much. I admit it, I hate to like it.	0
frida is certainly not a disaster, but neither is the Kahlo film that Frida fans are looking for.	0
Leaks emerge from every pore.	0
The characters are so general and the plot so bland that even as rogue killers working for the boss of Chri Cooper, we don't feel much sympathy for Damon or his dilemma.	0
Kapur burdens the story with bogus depth.	0
As we want MacDowell's character to bring her husband back, we must wonder if her personal odyssey surpasses the carnage that has claimed so many lives.	0
The blue stream is as predictable as the tides.    The film feels like it's sewn together from tribal situations and characters from other films.	0
If you like to be rewarded by a script that assumes you're not very clever, then blood work is for you.	0
In a way, every day is a success, but it's hard to like a film so cold and dead.	0
The stage art of the film is intimate and therefore bolder than the otherwise calculated artifice that dominates and overwhelms the film's production design.	0
A well-intentioned effort that is still too burdened by the actor's oblique sensations for the serious emotional core to emerge with a degree of accessibility.	0
A family-friendly fantasy that, with its imaginative premise, ultimately achieves very little.	0
A defiant look at the French Revolution through the eyes of aristocrats	0
Tom Shadyac has learned a little more craft since directing Adams, but he still perseveres at every point until the slowest viewer understands.	0
Like a pompous, low-key infomercial that combines entrepreneurial zeal with the statements of satisfied customers.	0

While certain hints, such as the joyful music, suggest that this film should warm our hearts, Jeong-hyang Lee's film will blacken that organ with cold revenge as well.	0
The script, the gags, the characters are all direct video products, and this film should have stayed that way.	0
A thriller without thrills and a thriller without urgent questions.	0
a collage of clichés and a faint echo of references to other films	0
The film is hampered by its predictable plot and gossamer supporting characters.	0
Artful gay film.	0
Jonas is just like that.   Adding a biblical message will either improve or diminish the movie for you.	0
A painful demonstration of the irrecoverability of a film burdened with an amateurish script.	0
How often will indie filmmakers tell us boring, self-important stories about how awful we are to ourselves and each other?	0
There are a few laughs in this film, but Williams's anarchy becomes annoying, the satire weak.	0
As steaming as last week's pork dumplings.	0
There is incoherence.	0
The dark tempo and lack of dramatic fireworks make the green dragon seem more like medicine than entertainment.	0
The filmmakers needed more emphasis on storytelling and less on the glamorous machine that propels audiences into a future that won't mean much to them.	0
Another entirely unnecessary addition to the growing, mouldy pile of, well, extreme stunt pictures.	0
This tiresomely unfunny Showtime deserves the hook.	0
It's pretty lame, making it a prime example of Disney sequels.	0

Nothing about this film works.	0
If the idea of a white man arriving on foreign shores to show the true light to wary locals is repulsive to you, the simplistic heaven is more likely to resemble hell.	0
A spooky yarn of demonic activity on the high seas, which works the better the less the brain is involved.	0
None of the calculated events surprises us.	0
Are monsters born or created?	0
Lisa Rinzler's cinematography may be beautiful, but the story of love Lisa herself practically falls into an inhalation failure and maintains consciousness just long enough to achieve a quiet claim.	0
The narrator and the other characters try to convince us that acting transfigures the ether, but it has never been seen on stage; one feels betrayed, and ether seems to remain an unchanged blunt.	0
It's exactly the kind of film critics always accuse him of.	0
With the dog days of August upon us, imagine this dog of a movie as the cinematic equivalent of high humidity	0
"It was less about ""Shakespeare"" than the amateur troupe of fools who watched Quentin Tarantino's handful of coarse gangster movies and took refuge in their own pseudo-funny copycat interpretations."	0
The film is like sitting in a downtown café, listening to a couple of typically late-twenties grumble about nothing and desperately wishing you could switch tables.	0
This rather unfocused, all-encompassing film would be much better if it reduced its storylines and characters to a few rather than dozens.   Or if it were more subtle.   or if she had a sense of humor.	0

The thoroughly formulaic film embodies not only the mainstream of the center, but also glossy Hollywood in its laziness.	0

Those who are only slightly curious will, I fear, be euthanized or confused by the artful and often meaningless images.	0
Tom Shadyac's film begins spooky enough, but halfway through it takes an abrupt turn into glucose sentimentality and ridiculous inventions.	0
a long, boring procession of despair, set to cello music from a minimalist funeral.	0
I call myself a cold-hearted failure because I can't enjoy a pointless action movie, but I think a movie can be pointless without being the pinnacle of everything.	0

Millions of dollars spent on a project of such enormous proportions have to go beyond fancy blue-screen technology and stylish weapons.	0
"""Freaky Friday,"" it's not."	0
Perhaps a film that is not so painfully forced, false and fabricated would be a better celebration of these wrongly dismissed heroes.	0
Although no pastries are hurt, this nasty comedy pokes fun at the same simple goals as other rowdy raunch feasts - farts, breasts, the unspeakable - without success.	0

You may be lucky and there will be a power cut during the performance, so you get your money back.	0
The characterizations and dialogues lack depth or complexity, with the ironic exception of Roller.	0
This film was made by and for the people who collect the serial killer cards and are fascinated by the mere suggestion of serial killers. For all of us, sitting through two hours is little more than punishment.	0
Narcissism can only remind us of brilliant crime dramas without becoming one.	0
Somewhere in the mess that is the globetrotter, a mediocre film tries to come out.	0
a tiresome parable about honesty and sportiness.	0
Their strengths and weaknesses are practically pitted against each other, with the unfortunate trump card being the dreary middle part.	0
An artful and at the same time depressing film that turns the molehill of a missing bike into a melodramatic mountain.	0
The film's ultimate point - that everyone should be themselves - is banal, but writer-director Michel Gondry repeats it to ridicule.	0
A brilliant knock-off of a B-movie revenge movie.	0
expands the horizon of boredom to collapse and turns into a black hole of boredom from which no interesting concept can escape.	0
It's just boring.	0
Sad nonsense, that. But not without a cheesy fun factor.	0
One of those decades-long historical epics that strives to be intimate and socially inclusive, but in three hours of screen time does not do justice to any of those efforts.	0
really stupid, but sometimes really funny.	0
The film oscillates between typical card sentimentality and silly, life-affirming moments straight from a mobile phone ad.	0
A half-hearted film.	0
The director's many evasions and twists result in little more than a handful of performances that promise little suspense and little profit.	0
"While the transgressive trappings (especially the overt sex scenes) ensure that the film never gets boring, Rodrigues ""self-contained metaphor is ultimately rather silly and exaggerated, making the ambiguous ending seem more stupid than provocative."	0
The satire is unfocused, while the story leads nowhere.	0
They threw a lot of money at an idea that should have been so much more, even if it was just for teenagers and wrestling fans.	0
It is embedded in a shabby script, piling layer upon layer of action-man clichés on wooden dialogue, and a shifting tone that falls far short of the peculiar moral amorality of the best work.	0
Reyes' directorial debut has good things to offer, but is ultimately undone by a sloppy script	0
If you are over 25 years old, have an iq over 90 and have a driving licence, you should find better entertainment.	0
The darker elements of misogyny and unprovoked violence suffocate the enlightenment created by the two daughters and the sparse humor that shines through the dark film-noir veil.	0
The cleverness of the image is ironically muted by those who make it shine.	0
"""lilo & stitch"" never reaches the emotion or timelessness of Disney's great past, or even recent successes like ""Mulan"" or ""Tarzan."	0
one of those so-called films that could have been much better.	0
Crossings feels like a teen-movie full of adolescent allusions to scandal and high-tension but limp dramas.	0
Genre politics, genre thrillers or its inherent humour are not sufficiently exploited.	0
The interview with the assassin is structured less as a documentary than as a find, and as such the film struggles to shake its roots in real time.	0
The vision of cacoyannis is far less mature and interprets the piece as a call to pity and sympathy for anachronistic phantasms chasing the imaginary glory of their own past.	0
It has more in common with a firework display than with a film that is normally expected to have characters and plot.	0
It seems to have been made by people who are completely alien to the idea of narrative logic or cohesion.	0
Not so much a heartfelt appeal for the disabled as a nice Belgian waffle.	0
Listening to extremist calls for names, whether you think of Kissinger as a calculating fiend or just a slippery self-promoter, does not help.	0
He spends 90 minutes trying to figure out whether some cocky, pseudo-intellectual child has deliberately left college or been killed. The only problem is that nobody in the audience or in the film seems to really care.	0
This is not a minimalist Beauty and the Beast, but in this case the beast should definitely get top billing. Robert john burke as the monster horns in and steals the show	0
Stoic, soap opera-like dialogue makes the rest of the cast look like stick figures reading lines from a teleprompter	0
[T] he film is never sure whether it will make a clear statement, even if it wants to rely on an ambiguous presentation.	0
Even if it doesn't add up to the sum of its parts, Holofzener's film offers just enough insight to save it from simplicity, and the cast is committed enough to keep you from sitting in an armchair too often.	0
A twisted Taiwanese soap about three people and their troubled relationship	0
No one seems to have cared about any aspect, from the cheesy script to the grey quality of the lighting to its haphazard last-minute release.	0
"A thoroughly horrible film - stupid, narrative chaotic, visually sloppy.   A strange amalgam of ""the thing"" and a geriatric ""scream"""	0
Another example of Sandler losing touch.	0
Nothing really sticks, except the lingering creepiness that one feels when being drawn through a sad, filthy universe of weapons, drugs, greed and destroyed dreams.	0
"What unfolds in the 110-minute ""panic room"" is a battle of the mind between an unwise mother and daughter and an even less capable criminal trio."	0
The inventions of the plot are uncomfortably charged.	0
Blame the worst sin that can be ascribed to a film like this: it's not scary in the least.	0
He bounces around with his wrists flaccid, wears tight tummies and a hip hug, twirls his hair on his finger and assumes that's enough to make you laugh.	0
Its simplicity puts an exclamation mark on the fact that this is not to be taken seriously, but also destroys any chance that the film will outgrow similar fare.	0
At the final whistle, one is convinced that this mean-spirited machine was a decent TV show that simply had no big screen magic.	0
To say that this steam-soaked vehicle is decidedly boring and uneventful is as obvious as telling a skunk that it has strong body odor.	0
A film of empty, fetishistic violence in which murder is casual and funny.	0
Imagine being a werewolf by avoiding eye contact and walking away slowly. It's fun, but it's a real howl.	0
some good acting, but ultimately a film for no reason.	0
It is difficult to feel anything other than slight disturbances or a distant pleasure in the game while watching this film.	0
"A water-saturated version of the ""fatal attraction"" for the teen bopper set.   A sorry, soggy cauldron squandering the talents of its attractive young executives."	0
It tells its story flat and leaves the impression that you should have got more out of it than you did.	0
Dear Jesus, did the scriptwriters just cut out all the bad action movies in history?	0
It's not the worst comedy of the year, but it certainly won't win an award.	0
This is largely a useless film, even with a great director at the helm.	0
A loud, mindless mess that lacks the charm and intrigue of the TV series.	0
Even in their own ridiculous conditions, the sum of all fears creates little narrative momentum and invites unflattering comparisons with other parts of the Ryan series.	0
Although it inspires some creative thinking (off the field), the film is - to its own detriment - much more of a cinematic collage than a polemic.	0
As predictable as the outcome of a game of globetrotting generals, juwanna mann is even more grotesque than you'd expect from the genre of the guy in the dress, and a personal low point for all involved.	0
sinks into the usual cafeteria goulash of fart, masturbation and racist Japanese jokes	0
Where Tom Green stages his gags as attacks on America's knee-jerk moral hypocrisy, Jackass lacks ambition for social change.	0
Rather a fascinating curiosity than a gripping thriller.	0
april 2002 part of the american war of independence, complete with lots of cgi and bushels of violence but not a drop of human blood.	0
contains all the substance of a Twinkie -- easy to swallow but hardly nutritious.	0
Return to neverland manages to draw the line between another classic for the company and another ordinary Disney sequel for the home video market.	0
Rarely does a film come across as gracefully and undeservedly as this one.	0
It's a thin performance that repeatedly stretches out, drowns in self-consciously shrill camera effects, booming house music and flat, flat dialogue.	0
On some level, Blue Crush keeps what it promises, just not good enough to recommend it.	0
the colourful masseur wastes his time on mood rather than riding on the inherent absurdity of Ganesh's ascent up the social ladder.	0
An incredibly ponderous, manipulative dud who feels all too familiar.	0

Madonna's face has now become so overgrown that there seems to be nothing left to work on, something like Michael Jackson's nose.	0
Since I have never seen the first two films in the series, I cannot compare Friday to Friday, but nothing would change the fact that we have a load of clams here that stay a good three days in the sweltering sun.	0
of the story lacks real emotional impact, and the plot is both constructed and cliché.	0
a depraved, incoherent, instantly available piece of hacking.	0
It's a bad action movie because there's no interest and the spectacle is grotesque and boring.	0
[Soderbergh] tends to put most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trusting the intelligence of the audience, and he creates a general sense of fragility.	0
Handsome and sincere, but a little clumsy in his combination of entertainment and evangelical boosterism.	0
So aggressively cheerful that Pollyana would reach for a barbag.	0
scooby-doo doesn't know if it's a retro retooling exercise for older fans or a silly, Nickelodeon-like kids movie.	0
Russell lacks visual verve, comic touch and perhaps the budget of the title fight.	0
highly uneven and contradictory.   Margarita Happy Hour is a bit like the El Cheapo margaritas it serves.	0
very stupid and annoying.	0
The sum of all fears pretends to be a serious investigation into nuclear terrorism, but in reality it is nothing more than warmed-up Cold War paranoia.	0
A listless and despondent affair.	0
represents the abyss into which the film, which behaves badly, fell.	0
How incompetent is the service to Sara? It makes even Elizabeth Hurley seem graceful and ugly.	0
Packed with literally agonising jokes. Someone is clocked about every five minutes.	0
"wins my vote for the film award ""Enemy of cinema 2002."""	0
Every Chekhov is better than no Chekhov, but it would be a shame if this were your introduction to one of the greatest plays of the last 100 years.	0
Helmer Hudlin tries to make a hip comedy, but his reliance on slapstick prevents the possibility of creating a darker tome.	0
Lazy, miserable and complacent. This is one of the biggest disappointments of the year.	0
Formula 51 has dulled your senses faster and deeper than any other recreational drug on the market.	0
Every visual wit is milked, every shot obvious and long-winded, every punchline predictable. There is no energy.	0
The writer and director Attal apparently thought he just had to pigeonhole himself and his movie star wife to justify a film.	0
After the setup, the air escapes from the film and flattens about one hour before the end.	0
This is a poster film, a mediocre homage to films like this!	0
With three hours and very little story or character development, there is plenty of room for editing, and a much shorter cut would surely have resulted in a smoother, more focused narrative without giving up any cultural intrigue.	0
A bit too derivative to stand on its own as the psychological thriller it purports to be.	0
A crude, youthful variation on a theme explored by playwright Craig Lucas in his prelude to a kiss, with infinitely more grace and eloquence.	0
The film's darker moments are smoothed out by the overwhelming need for tender, inspiring news, especially in the final sad moments.	0
When you recognize Zeus (the dog from the shredder), you wish to see the film at home and not in the cinema.	0
Abysmally pathetic	0
"It's the kind of film you only have to watch for about thirty seconds before you say, ""Oh yeah, here we have a bad, bad, bad movie."""	0
Shanghai ghetto should be praised for finding a new angle on a tireless story, but perhaps you should think twice before booking the trip.	0
Pieces like a checklist listing everything Reiners and his cast stole.	0
There is too much forced drama in this wildly unequal film about a young man's struggle with his inevitable past and uncertain future in a very malleable but largely unfulfilled present.	0
It is laughable and obsessively observable in its dedicated stupidity.	0
All the sensuality, all the eroticism of a good vampire fairy tale, forgive the pun, sucked up and replaced by goth kindness.	0
A cross between Blow and Boyz n the hood, this film aspires to be more, but doesn't quite achieve it. Good performances prevent it from becoming a total repetition.	0
The script is enormously over-written, with innumerable dialogue - most of it aimed at children.	0
Let the cult section of your local video store troll for the real deal.	0
Sometimes the film looks really nice. Your nightmares, on the other hand, are far from easy. not even felinni knew what to think of this Italian freakshow.	0
elmo advertises its drug as 51 times stronger than coke. If you're looking for a story about British bad behaviour, watch how they behave. 51 times better than this.	0
It is hard to imagine anyone who has reached puberty actually finding the characters in Slackers or their antics amusing or even funny.	0
"Despite its promising character portrayal, the big trouble remains a loosely linked series of vignettes that only prove that ""crazy"" doesn't necessarily mean ""funny."	0
Shrill and soporific at the same time, and because everything is repeated five or six times, it can seem tediously simple.	0
does not go far enough in its humor or ideas to be particularly memorable or even funny.	0
Neither overtly nor really edgy - just crassly extravagant and comedic.	0
Just about everyone involved here seems to be swimming. There are a few modest laughs, but no thrills.	0
fails so fundamentally on any conventional level that it reaches a kind of foolish size.	0
There is a lingering theatrical mood and a blurry quality to the way the story is told that undermines the devastating narrative effect of the total loss embodied in the film's simple title.	0
While Howard's appreciation of Brown and his writing is clearly well-meaning and sincere, the film would be impossible to sustain without the supporting cast.	0
A grotesque, prudish journeyman.	0
Go, girls, down the reality drain.	0
With some of the worst staged and illuminated action in memory, Hoax is as close as an imitation movie.	0
"can be classified as one of these ""alternative reality films.""   Except that it would have worked so much better if we had acted in a reality."	0
Predictable and enticing, though brown sugar is so earnest in its nostalgia for the days before nihilism that it evokes more spirit and bite than the average formula-romantic square.	0
unlikeable, uninteresting, unfunny and totally inept.	0
The film is so busy referring to other films and trying to be other films that it doesn't have its own heart, mind or humour.	0
An imponderably stilted and self-consciously artistic film.	0
Confused, melodramatic paranormal romance is an all-time low for Kevin Costner	0
Too clumsy at crucial moments.   to cause a sensation.	0
Just a few good actors buzzing around in a hoodie that's neither original nor terribly funny.	0
Everywhere there are Matrix-style massacres.   But the film has a harder time balancing its violence with Kafka-inspired philosophy.	0
At least it's a pretty impressive debut from director Charles Stone.	0
Everything is predictable, and the adventures that take place along the way seem to repeat themselves, designed to fill time without really creating tension.	0
Goths wanker off! Run for your life!	0
Why would anyone want to play the great Jackie Chan in a film full of stunt doubles and special effects?	0
A raven-black, emaciated strip.	0
In the film, an unambitious writing appears, using a plot that could be taken from an animated film script.	0
is a good argument, without giving us any reason to go beyond basic principles of human decency.	0
We have poignant images that defy farce, thoughtful dialogue pushed aside by one-liners, and a visual style that includes rotoscope animations for no apparent reason, except perhaps that it looks neat.	0
Unbearably lame.	0
According to the script, Grant and Ox are made for each other. But you would never guess that from the performances.	0
The animation merely serves up a predictable, maudlin story that weighs heavily on Bambi and the Lion King, but lacks the emotional resonance of any of these films.	0
Araat feels like a book	0
steve oedekerk is unfortunately not a woody all.	0
Much like the imaginary sport he projects on the screen - loud, violent and mindless.	0
An amalgam of fleeting, fleeting and total recall, but without much energy or tension.	0
The plot is amateurish, the cinematography gruesome, the direction clumsy, the writing flimsy and the violence lurid and ridiculously unconvincing.	0
shows that jackie chan is getting older, and that's something I'd rather deny	0
with miscast cast, banal dialogues and an absurdly exaggerated climax, the gentle killing belongs firmly in the camp of the so-called bad-is-good.	0
Unfortunately, the black-and-white archive footage of her nude shows pretty mediocre shit.	0
The slapstick is worked, the larger parts flat.	0
This is the kind of movie where people who have never chosen a castle become fighters so easily after a few attempts.	0
The problem with the mess in Formula 51 is not that it is offensive, but that it is boring.	0
Much of the digitally altered footage seems jagged, as if it were filmed directly from a television screen, while the extensive use of footage quickly becomes an annoying cliche.	0
The film never rises above a conventional, two-dimensional story	0
Mark Wahlberg.   He may look classy in a 1960s Pokepie hat, but as a character he's dry, dry, dry.	0
The film only occasionally does justice to the stories, faces and music of the men involved.	0
The irony is that the cast of this film is uniformly excellent; their performances could - and should - have been left alone.	0
"Now I can understand why people thought I was being too harsh with the ""moths"" prophecies."	0
If ever a concept was handed down from the film gods on a silver tray, this is it. If ever such a reliable concept was botched in execution, this is it.	0
"With an unusual protagonist (a kilt-wearing Jackson) and theme, the unlikely ""Formula 51"" is a little entertaining, but could have been much stronger."	0
Sandra Bullock's best dramatic performance yet (is) almost enough to lift (this) thrill-killer cat and mouse.   above his plot by numbers.	0
A feel-good film that doesn't give enough to feel good about.	0
"Adolescents will be adequately served by the film's ophomoric mix of tricks and slapstick, even if the more lascivious minds might be disappointed by the relative modesty of a film that offers ""topless lessons."""	0
This image of a false identity is so cinematically referential that the end product is a spirit.	0
The picture proves surprisingly anemic.	0
de niro cries. You will cry for your money.	0
Hit me, I saw this movie.	0
[The child's] just too cheeky for pity, and as the film grows to its finale, its little changes ring hollow.	0
Behind the glamour, Hollywood is filthy and disgusting. Surprise!	0
The actress, who has had a successful career in television, tackles more than she can handle.	0
Just think what your new best friend doesn't have, starting with the small omission of a script.	0
oscar caliber cast doesn't do the material justice	0
The problems of lovers in the time of money are hardly specific to their time. They simply have problems that are neither original nor convincing.	0
"With this wafer-thin film on his nimble shoulders, Chan wades through rotten writing, direction and timing with a smile that says, ""If I stay positive, I may be able to channel one of my greatest images, Drunk Master."""	0
So rotten that it's not worth the price of the match to burn every film.	0
In the end, the film sinks into insignificance, saying nothing about Kennedy's assassination, and betraying nothing about the pathology it purports to investigate.	0
starts chic and elegant, but does not keep pace and becomes entangled in clichés	0
Sometimes it makes less sense than the Bruckheimer-style American action flicks it emulates.	0
One of those films where the characters live in this particular annex of hell, where adults behave like children, children like adults and everyone screams to their heart's content.	0

Evil at home comes from taking John Zimmerman's March ghosts and removing the beheadings. In other words, you'll probably see a bad movie like this all year.	0
Five screenwriters are credited with the clichéd script; it seems as if everyone has watered down the previous one.	0
The whole thing feels like a particularly amateurish episode of Enchanted, set during the spring break.	0
Well done, but without involvement, Bloodwork is not a terrible film, just a blunt one - an unrewarding collar for murder.	0
So we have ten little Indians meeting Friday the 13th in clean and sober fashion, filmed on the set of Schreiner's the Thing and loaded with actors you will most likely find in the next inevitable incarnation of the love boat.	0
The film's blatant derivative is one reason it's so lackluster.	0

It's the humanizing stuff that will sink the film for anyone who doesn't spend all day thinking about percentages.	0

What could have been a pointed little cooler about the daunting seductiveness of new technologies loses faith in its own viability and succumbs to joyless special-effects excess.	0

Unless Bob Crane is someone you're particularly interested in, but the film's impressive performances and deft direction won't leave a lasting impression.	0
The rock has a great presence, but battle after battle is not the same as a battle followed by deadly cgi effects.	0
The bottom line is that the nemesis is the same as with all the films in the series: fans will undoubtedly enjoy it, and the uncommitted don't need to waste their time.	0
lousy john q spits out denzel washington's fine performance in the title role.	0
The whole thing feels like a ruse, a tactic to disguise the fact that the picture is built around a core of flimsy - or worse, nonexistent - ideas.	0
What a suffocatingly unfunny and unoriginal mess!	0
The film is so full of subplots about the various silver stones that it feels more like the pilot episode of a TV series than a feature film.	0
Opera on film is never satisfactory. Art demands live observation. the innate theatricality, which offers thrills and extreme emotions, loses its shine when flattened on screen.	0
Despite all the closed doors, the film is essentially juiceless.	0
It is narrow-minded, accessible to a select few, repugnant to everyone else, and smugly suggests that a superior moral tone is more important than cinematic art.	0
the sweetest leaves a terribly sour taste.	0
It has lost politics and social observation, and is just another romance about a couple stuck in an inarticulate script.	0
Definitely bland, painfully slow and unnecessarily confusing.   The film, which was not recorded on film but on digital videotape, is often indecipherable.	0
Silly and cheesy as they may be, the cartoons seem almost wobbly - both in depth and breadth - after seeing this supposedly family-friendly comedy loaded with digital effects.	0

The plot of the film is almost completely witless and nonsensical, carrying each gag two or three times over its limit to bear a laugh.	0
It may work as an addictive school treat, but the material never overcomes its questionable satirical ambivalence. This scarlet letter is one.   as in aimless, laborious and arbitrary.	0

The film's cumbersome script quickly navigates pomp and presumption.	0
A potentially good comic premise and excellent cast are terribly wasted.	0
Woody Allen used to mock movies like the Hollywood ending. Now he does.	0
She is not an actress yet, not a singer.	0

"Even if it had reached its original release date last fall, it would have smelled of a ""been there,"" of that equality."	0
Only two-fifths of a satisfactory film experience.	0

[l] ame and unnecessary.	0
a film version of a picture by numbers. We can say what it is supposed to be, but not really call it a work of art.	0
It's a brilliant, honest performance from Nikolson, but the film is excruciatingly boring, except when the fantastic Kathy Bates appears. Bravo Kathy!	0
liotta is put in an impossible place, because the deceptions of his character ultimately destroy him and the credibility of the entire scenario. What a shame.	0
You can thank me for that. I've seen juwanna man, so you don't have to.	0
Unfunny and lacking any sense of attachment or affection for its characters, the Reginald Hudlin comedy relies on toilet humour, ethnic insults.	0

Co-writer and director Jonathan Parker's attempts to create a Brazilian, hyper-real satire go horribly wrong.	0
If this silly little cartoon can inspire some children not to grow up to be greedy bastards, more power.	0

What is missing from murder by numbers is a real psychological justification for teenage deviance. Being latently gay and enjoying reading is hardly enough.	0
An uninspired preaching and clichéd war film.	0
Horribly amateurish filmmaking, which is simply boring and visually ugly if not incomprehensible.	0
"A film that rides on medially constructed ""themes,"" such as whether compromise is the death of the self, will make this orgasm most memorable."	0

If a swimsuit fan gets her way, it may be because teenagers are looking for something to make them laugh.	0
What might have been an exciting exploration of a strange love triangle becomes a proliferation of uncoordinated vectors.	0
The master of disguise may have made a great Saturday Night Live skit, but he's not a great movie.	0
It is quite an achievement to shoot a film at the Cannes Film Festival and not capture its visual appeal or atmosphere.	0
boll uses a lot of fast editing and blurred steps to shake things up, but blurred dialogue and sometimes inadequate performances kill the effect.	0
It is always disappointing when a documentary does not do justice to its chosen theme - or offers new insights. Unfortunately, that's exactly what the family is doing.	0

Like a mediocre network sitcom - mostly harmless, witty, but ultimately so weightless that a neat design in the auditorium could blow it off the screen.	0
Something must have got lost in the translation.	0
is the last thing you would expect from a film with this title or even a Plympton film: boring.	0
In the end, the film seems homogenized and a little contrived, as if we were looking back with rose-tinted glasses on a tattered and ugly past.	0
Chan's stunts are limited and edited to such an extent that there is little left of action or even action comedy.	0
The stand-up magic of rock is fading. Hopkins, fills the screen. Action - mechanical.	0
"""The Tuxedo"" should have been the vehicle for Chan, that ""the mask"" was for Jim Carrey. Unfortunately, it is the man who makes the clothes."	0
For casual filmmakers who stumble into rules expecting a slice of American Pie hijinks with the kid from Dawson's Creek, they will probably run out screaming.	0
The biggest problem I have (apart from the very slow pace) is that we never really see her blossom as an actress, even though her talent is growing.	0
What amazes me is the lack of emphasis on music in Britney Spears' first film.	0
Plot, characters, drama, emotions, ideas - everything is irrelevant to the experience of seeing the Scorpio King.	0
City by the Sea is a dark police thriller with all the dysfunctional family dynamics you could want. But how it all turned out is the project's biggest mystery.	0
Whatever the film's sentimental, hypocritical teachings on sexism, its true colours come out in various wet T-shirt and shower scenes.	0
As a hybrid teen thriller and crime thriller, Murder by Numbers fits too well into the profile.	0
There's nothing more painful than an unfunny movie that finds it funny.	0
i liked the film superficially while i was never sure what its purpose was.	0
Pity.   that the material is so secondary.	0
does not deliver a great story, and the plot is not as gripping as in past Seagal films.	0
The kind of film that leaves you stunned that so many talented people were able to participate in such an ill-advised and badly executed idea.	0
Nicks refuses to see Slacker as just another teen movie, which means he can be forgiven for frequently turning to fans of crass comedy.	0
Nothing in the film is authentic - with the possible exception of Eliza Hurley's breasts.	0
Amid the clichés and premonitions, Cage manages a degree of casual realism.   which is routinely blown up by Blethyn.	0
Shafer and co-author Gregory Hinton mostly lack a strong attitude or sense of humour.	0
"No cliché escapes the perverse treatment of gang warfare, which is described as ""wild."""	0
Eddie Murphy and Owen Wilson have a sweet partnership in a spy movie, but the movie around them is so often almost nothing that its charm doesn't bring much.	0
"In the worst sense of the word, a ""men's film."""	0
There is some good material in her story about a retail clerk who wants more out of life, but the film too often revolves around familiar situations and repeating scenes.	0
It is a lot to ask people to sit still for two hours and look at such a figure, especially when it is portrayed as flat and passive as Phoenix.	0
There's something nasty about a Christmas movie.   , which derives its moment of most compelling emotional gravity from a scene in which Santa Claus gives gifts to adults.	0
We are left with a story that tries to seize us, only to let go at the wrong moments.	0
Like many biographical melodramas, it suffers from the awkwardness that comes from clinging to the clutter of true stories.	0
There's nothing redeeming about this film.	0
The film has [its] moments, but there are few.	0
A dreary delight.	0
I wanted to decide what annoyed me most about God.   I'm not, and then I realised I just didn't care.	0
Derailed by bad writing and possibly some of the extensive post-production to target young men in the midst of their first testosterone rush.	0
earns good marks for political courage, but barely gets by with his artistic achievements.	0
comes alive only when it switches to the sentimental.	0
Brosnan's finest non-bondlike performance, however, fails to overcome the film's manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes.	0
A film that is best appreciated by those who are prepared to endure its extremely slow rhythms and wait for happiness without much dramatic effect.	0
To me, it sounds like a cruel deception by men of marginal intelligence, with reactionary ideas about women and a complete lack of empathy.	0
tsai may be ploughing the same furrow too often.	0
Flashy gadgets and swirling battle sequences may look cool, but they can't distract from the flawed support structure that keeps the balance.	0
Zigzag might have been richer and more attentive if it had been less dense.	0
[a] crushing disappointment.	0
How can such a cold film claim to express warmth and longing? In truth, it has the whole gist of a porn movie (but none of the pure lust).	0
Nicks and Steinberg bring their own creations to the market out of pure venality - that's what the old college gives her.	0
Episode II - Attack of the Clones is a technological exercise that lacks juice and joy.	0
The problem with all this is that it's not really funny.	0
[denis'] bare-bones narrative is more like a blueprint for a 1970s exploitation picture than the finished product.	0
travels the map thematically and stylistically, borrowing heavily from Lynch, Jeunet and von trier, but finding no spark of his own.	0
Watching this underdramatised but exaggerated film is like viewing the transcript of a therapy session brought to life by a joyful doll.	0
All in all, such folly is flavour.	0
"The mantra behind the project seems to be ""it's just a snap."" Translation: ""We don't have to make a big effort."""	0
In all the annals of films, few were so strange, inexplicable and unpleasant.	0
It takes a really long, slow and dreary time to figure out what tuck forever is all about. So here it is: this is about a family of acid immortals.	0
an essentially unpleasant version of the lightweight image of female empowerment that we have been seeing for decades	0
The author's followers will probably find it fascinating; others will find it confusing.	0
Writer-director Walter Hill and co-writer David Giller try to create characters from the obvious clichés, but end up using them as punch bags.	0
There is a scientific law here that producers should heed: mediocre films drag on as soon as the plot accelerates; when the explosions begin, they fall apart.	0
A daring shot.	0
lush and beautifully photographed (someone suggested that the stills might be a nice coffee table book), but ultimately you leave the theater wondering why these people were important.	0
Unfortunately, the one-hour photo matches his title. Thanks to Williams, all interesting developments are processed in 60 minutes - the rest is just overexposed film waste.	0
cold, sterile and without any colour or heat.	0
The film is nullified by anachronistic edits and the occasional harrowing gaze of a modern theatre audience watching.	0
seems like someone is going through the movements.	0
"For a film about explosions and death and spies, ""ballistics: Sever ""seems as safe as a children's movie. Well, in some cases even the mother dies."	0
Wallace sometimes gets a bit ponderous with his message and has a visual flair that seems far too poetic for our taste.	0
Despite a remarkably strong cast, Hochstapler doesn't do much with his original.	0
cloaks itself in the guise of a dark and quirky comedy, but it is not as quirky as it thinks, and its comedy is generally mean.	0
"Hacked off, over-long documentary about ""lifestyle."""	0
You hurl yourself through the swamp of this supposed psychological thriller in search of meaning or even a plot.	0
A film that puts familiar tropes at the service of clear and conventional historical fiction when it comes to what we ask of the director.	0
"It's a fanboy ""what if?"" on the big screen."	0
The story itself is actually quite vague.	0
It is a hellish, numbing experience to look at, and it does not offer insights that were not thoroughly discussed in the media back in Dahmer's heyday in the mid-1990s.	0
Wait for payment per view or rent, but don't leave the hair salon out of hand.	0
A few zingers aside, the writing is indifferent, and Jordan Brady's direction is sober.	0
Every scene drags on, emphasizing the obvious, and the mood is crushed.	0
It would have been nice if the scriptwriters had trusted the audience to understand a complex story and omitted the predictable resolution of the film. Nadia's birthday might not have been such a bad day after all.	0
One of those stunningly well-produced, joylessly extravagant images that whips you hastily, empty from one visual wonder to another.	0
It simply lacks the self-control needed to guide a loose, poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy.	0
The film enthusiastically takes up the current teen-themed bodily functions and pushes all demographically appropriate comic buttons.	0
It's the funniest American comedy since Graffiti Bridge.	0
The fact that none of the protagonists has a recognizable state hardly matters, because both are merely active brews, characterized by childish inertia and a handful of quirks.	0
What begins as a potential Argentine beauty smells like a room full of sharp flowers.	0
The project's filmmakers forgot to consider anything remotely frightening, because they misrepresented the fatal appeal of a high school scenario.	0
"in old-fashioned script jargon. Shreve's novel proved too difficult to ""lick"" a text, despite the best efforts of a first-class cast."	0
Solondz is probably the only one laughing at his own joke	0
Stich is a bad mannerist, ugly and destructive little * * * *. Not a sweet factor. The problem is that he has no character, lovable or not.	0
Deep down, I realized the harsh reality of my situation: I left the theater with a lower self.  than when I entered.	0
A really funny fifteen-minute short film that went beyond its limits to fill an almost full-length film.	0
Apart from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom. com or the inappropriately poor performance of poor pansies, the film gets extra scorn for the fact that it is almost impossible to watch or understand.	0
It's bad, but certainly not without entertainment value.	0
For its 100 minutes of running time, you wait in vain for a film.	0
A work that lacks both meaning and impulse.	0
a faster family film. The upper teens might be cynical. smaller, numbered kidlets.	0
"Although this film has an ""A"" cast and some strong supporting actors, the story - like its main character, Vivi - is just a bit hard to love."	0
It's a road trip drama with too many failures.	0
Most fish stories are a bit strange, but these should be thrown back into the river.	0
It doesn't take long for Schwentke to satisfy a gross quota for an expected audience, rather than making the material fit the story.	0
"""I blame all men for the war,"" [the warden's daughter] tells her father. The film is about as deep as that feeling."	0
It's funny, but it never really takes off.	0
I've seen some bad actors, but lil bow wow takes the cake.	0
Halfway through, I started to hate it, and of course I felt guilty.    Then, miracle after miracle, the film flips.	0
Despite all the complications, everything is surprisingly predictable.	0
It's been 20 years since 48. Eddie Murphy has become a movie star and the man is not a day older. But his showboat personality is certainly getting old.	0
If the wild twos had been turned up a notch, it would have been a camp adventure, one of those films that are so bad they become good. But it wasn't.	0
For an action movie, Ultimate X is the biggest-screen movie of all time, mired in a flood of hype.	0
A low-rate Annie, in which you see some kid who can't act, just an echo of Jordan and a weird actor messing things up in old school.	0
It may not be 1970s animation, but everything else about it is straight out of the Saturday morning cartoons, a retread of history, bad writing and the same old silliness.	0
The image seems uncertain whether it wants to be a sour, all-male evening or a lush, powerless melodrama in the interlude.	0
tends to trick.	0
Nearly 21 / 2 hours, the film is far too indulgent.	0
Gorgeous to look at, but unbearably dull and dreary.   A strangely constricted epic.	0
It ends up looking a lot more like a caricature than The Simpsons ever had.	0
With a streamlined editing process and alignment, this material could work, especially as the lead actors are all more than competent, but as it is, personal speed seems idle.	0
does not really add up.	0
It's better suited for the history or biography channel, but there's no arguing about the tone of the film - it leaves a bad taste in the mouth and questions in the mind.	0
A conversation so in love with its exaggerated mythology that it no longer recognizes the audience's need for real characters and compelling plots.	0
a prolonged extrusion of psychopathic pulp.	0
Borrowing from other films like this in the most mundane and obvious way.	0
It's surprisingly bland, despite the high dose of odd performances and direction.	0
"a cool, distanced, emotionally distanced piece.   So boring that his slogan should be: ""In space, nobody hears you snore."""	0
The characters seem one-dimensional, the film is superficial and should be of interest to the target group.	0
Sorvino makes the princess seem smug and graphic, and the film only really comes alive when poor Hermocrats and Leontine pathetically compare notes about their burgeoning loves.	0
It's like a drive-by. You can drive right past it without noticing anything special, except a few strange twists, intended or not.	0
Everything - even life on an aircraft carrier - is sentimental.	0
"This would-be James Bond picture for the extreme generation is a big, stupid action movie. Stress ""stupid."""	0
The film has general virtues and, despite many talents involved, seems done with numbers.	0
If your theme is illusion versus reality, shouldn't reality at least seem passably real?	0
It's a terrible film in every sense and painful to watch.	0
It's creepy, an original idea (or role or editing or score or anything, really) is not in sight, and the whole process begs the question why?	0
A fan movie that is better played on video for the uninitiated when the sound is off.	0
too annoyingly quirky and with his own style.	0
At the heart of this little coming-of-age / coming-out story is plenty of nothing.	0
As much as I laughed throughout the film, I cannot convincingly defend the film as entertainment or even performance art, although you have to marvel at the superhuman ability of these guys to stand pain.	0
The kind of dumb stereotype exercise that gives the genre [teen comedy] a bad name.	0
Significantly below average.   It is more likely that a spectator will drown in boredom than that a shudder will run down his back.	0
plays like a bad mix of an overripe episode of Dawson's Creek on TV and a recycled and dumbed down version of the love story.	0
If you don't come into the film with a skateboard under your arm, you don't feel invited to the party.	0
"When the casting call for this film went out, it must have said: ""Look for someone with acting ambition but no sense of pride or shame."""	0
is just not as funny as it should be.	0
"A ""home alone"" film, staged like ""Rosemary's Baby,"" but not as well conceived as any of these films."	0
[Siegel] and co-writers Lisa Bazadona and Grace Woodard have relied too much on convention to create the characters that surround openness.	0
No film could make the single female population more despicable.	0
"""Hey arnold!"" has some visual wit.   but little imagination elsewhere."	0
You go through the motions but the zipper is gone.	0
A slow pace and the lack of real storytelling in every way haunt the film, as does life itself.	0
The tadpole was captured on digital video, and the images often seem smeared and blurred to the point of distraction. In a better film, you might not have noticed.	0
It's pointless crap like this, which values original romantic comedies like punch-drunk love.	0
"The film is like a year too late to tap into our reality TV obsession, and even more late to take advantage of the novelty of ""webcast."""	0
"Anyone who has seen George Roy Hill's 1973 film ""The Stinger"" will know the story all too well."	0

It's hard to joke with a handle that boasts so many real snaps but infamous c.   still feels like a promising work-in-progress.	0

A great waste.   Generic.	0
The problem with bread is that it's far too sentimental.	0
A nightly cable explosion masquerading as a thriller about the ruthless social order of college cliques.	0
The music and its roots are not explained.	0
inspires never more than an interested distance.	0
What could have been (at least during its heyday in the seventies) a hilarious craziness in the hands of Woody Allen or Mel Brooks seems lame and second-rate in this first indie feature.	0
Despite slick production values and director Rob Mitchell's tick-tick pace, the end result is like two guys screaming in your face for two hours.	0
pretty sucks but has a funny moment or two.	0
They did a good job of painting this family dynamic for the audience, but they tried to squeeze too many elements into the film.	0
A supernatural mystery that doesn't know whether it's going to be a thrilling horror film or a weeping melodrama. In the end, it is neither and fails in both efforts.	0
two poorly intertwined stories, drowned in too clever complexity.	0
It's so serious, so overblown and so unbelievably implausible that it begs parody.	0
These are textbook lives of quiet despair	0
Swimming fans go overboard with a crazy melodramatic exclamation, like a fatal attraction, in which a high school swimming pool replaces a bath.	0
claims to separate the bad from the good, which is its main problem.	0
Deliberately shocking in its eroticised gore, if unintentionally boring in its lack of poetic friction.	0
feels like a bunch of other, better movies that got beaten up.	0
Almost everything about the film is disturbing, from the grotesque hairpiece worn by Lai's villainous father to the endless action sequences.	0
Writer-director Randall Wallace has bitten off more than he or anyone else could chew, and his film moves like a drunk driver through heavy traffic.	0
It follows the witchcraft formula for an hour, in which something creepy and vague is in progress, and then it goes wrong in the last 30 minutes.	0
You can't shake off the feeling that Crossroads is no more than an hour and a half long commercial for Britney's latest album.	0
Business as usual.	0
There is an epic here, but you have to put it together yourself.	0
What atmosphere is created by shadowy lighting, macabre backdrops, and endless rain is offset by the sheer ugliness of everything.	0
Director and chef Gabriele Muccino keeps it quick -- zippy, comin'at ya -- as if he fears his film is too superficial.	0
Tartakowski's team has some freaky visual charm, but the five authors fall into the modern mould of narrative banality.	0
"The most horrible film experience I've had since ""can't stop the music."" You might as well call it ""jar-jar binks: the movie. It's that painful."	0
God is great, the film isn't.	0
Like a circus with three teams, there are plenty of side stories - none memorable.	0
When in doubt, the film creaks the stirring soundtrack, throws in a fish-out-of-water gag and lets the clichéd dialogue break. Or a dog winks.	0
"A ""Girls gone wild"" video for the boho art house crowd, the burning sensation is not a definitive countercultural document - its creators are not remote and curious enough."	0

You may be appalled that you wasted almost two hours of your own precious life with this stupid little puddle.	0
It's not as juicy as Big Daddy or as anarchic as Happy Gilmore or The Waterboy, but it has its moments.	0
Despite the surface attractions -- conrad l. The cinematography of the hall is likely to be nominated for an Oscar next year - there is something impressive and yet lacking.	0

Go for la salle's performance and settle for a stuttering script.	0
It's hard to be interested in a film that, as an epic tragedy, tells the plight of a calf-rich boy forced to choose between his beautiful, self-satisfied 22-year-old girlfriend and an equally beautiful, self-satisfied 18-year-old lover.	0
tries too much to be funny, too loud, too stupid and too little attention.	0
I didn't find much fascinating about swinging. What they do is a matter of plumbing and mind games, without erotic or sensual charge. But for them to do it is thought provoking.	0
The spectacle is fine, but there is not enough substance to sustain interest for the full 90 minutes, especially given the weak payout.	0
After collateral damage, you might think that almost every stereotype of a father has dissolved. But no.	0
Ultimately, that, yes, snail pace and lack of thematic resonance make the film more silly than scary, like a sort of Martha Stewart decoration program running amok.	0

Long-winded Norwegian bid that somehow prevented Oscar nomination	0

Seagal is painfully foolish in trying to hold on to what's left of his choppy fame.	0
Even with Harris's strong commitment, the script gives him little to examine effectively Lear's soul-crushing collapse.	0
The story is fake and its characters thin.	0
While the ultra-competent Hitman films such as Pulp Fiction and Short have a sardonic verve for their caustic raison d'etre, who's this? is an unspeakable and boring wannabe who is looking for exactly this niche.	0
While the American adobo has his heart (and palate) in the right place, his brain is a little scattered - even delicate.	0
A confusing drudgery.	0
Imagine a film that starts out as seven rip-offs, only to switch to a mixture of glamour, the thing and some naked teenage horror film from the 1980s.	0
Most of the dialogue got me packing raw dough into my ears.	0
Costner's warm milk persona is as incongruous as Shadyac's superficial directorial instructions, and some of the overtly silly dialogue would sink Laurence Olivier.	0
It's coherent, well shot and well acted, but it wears you down like a dinner guest presenting his PhD.	0
The director is Kevin Bray, whose crisp, angular cinematography and utter incompetence in acting, sound and tempo clearly distinguish him as a video hero.	0

A well-made decline.	0
is a boring, somnambulous exercise in presumption, the omnipresent calm of which is interrupted by frequent outbreaks of violence and noise.	0
It deserves its critical backlash and more.	0
boring and meandering.	0
Neither a rousing success nor a blinding embarrassment. Still, it sits there like a side dish nobody orders.	0
The sum of all fears is remarkably confused about motifs and context, depriving them of the dramatic substance that shakes us in our boots (or cinema seats)	0
the film spends more time with tailors than with the new mcadams, although their presentation is more interesting (and fun) than his.	0
"This cheap - and even less funny - rip-off from the Farrell brothers ""oeuvre gets way too mushy - and in relatively short order."	0
It recycles every cliché about gays in an essentially extended soap opera.	0
I'm all for the mentally handicapped getting their chance in the film business, but it doesn't necessarily have to be a bunch of shrewd and self-mutilating supporting actors.	0

Many elements of Benjamin feel as if they have emerged from an episode of mimic vices.	0
It tries aimlessly and unsuccessfully to merge at least three boring plots into one good one.	0
Most people who are really interested in the American sexual landscape will find it either moderately amusing or simply irrelevant.	0
If you are not a fan of the adventures of steve and terri, you should avoid this like the dreaded king snake. Personally, I would rather watch them on the planet.	0
Cherish is a dud - a romantic comedy that is not in the least romantic and only mildly funny.	0

The calculus of the filmmakers cannot save brown sugar from the curse of blonde.	0
The dark atmosphere of the film is fascinating, even if the film itself has no chance.	0

the exclamation mark seems to be the only grain of joy to be found in this dreary mess.	0
Whichever way you slice it, Mark Wahlberg and Thandie Newton are no Hepburn and Grant, two cinematic icons with ample chemistry.	0
Godard's ode to the wonder of life is a sweeping and incoherent manifesto about the fuzziness of contemporary excess.   Praise of love remains a ponderous and presumptuous undertaking, unfocused and tiring.	0
humourless, self-confident art that comes into being without a hint of intelligence or invention.	0
"The film's continuing incoherence gives new meaning to the phrase ""fatal script error."""	0
Solondz may be convinced that he has something significant to say, but he doesn't talk a conversation I like.	0
Tired of everything else.	0
Sandel's intentions are good, but the end result does not do history justice. It's terribly depressing and not very well done.	0
Its star Kline's efforts to inject some dignity into a silly story are futile.	0
A good-natured ensemble comedy that tries to get the best out of a good cast but never really gets going.	0
Isn't it a little early in his career that director Barry Sonnenfeld pays homage to himself? And that's pathetic.	0
too long and adorable.	0
I walk on one leg. It's not one of the worst films of the year. It's just very bad.	0
Writer-director Ritchie reduces Wertmuller's social mores and politics to annoying jargon.	0
About Amy's cuteness, Amy's career success (she's a best-selling author of self-help books who can't help herself) and Amy's neurosis in men.	0
Everything about girls can't swim, even the passages of sensitive observation feel familiar - and not good.	0
feels aimless for much of its running time, until late in the film a tidal wave of action sets in and leaves questions.	0
less than fresh.	0
In my own very humble opinion, the praise of love lacks even the most fragmented charms I have found in almost all of his earlier works.	0
The script is too mainstream and psychology too textbook to intrigue.	0
Confused, simplistic and more than a little pretentious.	0
Meandering and glaciated and often simply boring.	0
A disaster of a drama saved only by his winged attackers.	0
"A road trip that makes you think: ""Are we there yet?"""	0
Director Elie Chouraqui, who co-wrote the script, captures the chaotic horror of war, but why bother to submit the truth to the tearful demands of soap opera?	0
He never pushes for insights beyond the superficial tensions of the dynamics he dissects, and the film sits too lightly along the contours of expectation.	0
If there was any doubt that Peter o'Fallon did not have an original bone in his body, a rumour about angels should dispel it.	0
an occasionally interesting, but mostly repetitive look at a piece of counterculture that is best forgotten.	0
What could have been a nifty plot line in Steven Soderbergh's traffic fails to achieve any satisfactory end.	0
The film is like Scorsese's mean streets, rebuilt by someone who ignored him in favour of old paperbacks with titles like Leather Warriors and Sexpot.	0
This pathetic rubbish is barely an hour long. Still, it seems endless.	0
It is not that the theft of crops is a terrible motive, only that it has failed so spectacularly! It's just that it's not good at all. And I expect a lot more from such an outstanding talent as director bruce mcculloch	0
Dolman confines himself to hype and sentimentality - one bald, another sloppy.	0
Is it possible that a documentary is completely enraptured by its subject and yet shows virtually no understanding?	0
It's supposed to be a romantic comedy - she suffers from too much Norma Rae and too little pretty woman.	0

The script? Please.	0
The film oscillates between limp satire and a supposedly mad farce.	0
Not that any of us should complain if a film lasts 90 minutes these days, but the plot leaves something to be desired.	0
Ingenious, artistic and silent, almost suffocating.	0
plays like the old melodramas of the disease of the week in miniature.	0
Like life on the island, the film is boring despite the setting.	0
The truth about Charlie is that it is a shamelessly misguided project.	0
The man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud and money laundering.	0

It's the kind of uninspired, over-the-top venture that gives Hollywood sequels a bad name.	0
Rosenthal (halloween ii) seems to have forgotten everything he ever knew about creating tension.	0
Even Murphy's comedic timing and famous charisma can't save these efforts.	0
Rodriguez.   was unable to reproduce the special spark between the characters that made the first film so enjoyable.	0
an elegant advertisement for youthful anomie that never quite matches the sum of its claims.	0
Some bodies smell more like exhibitionism than cathartic truth-telling.	0
This is by no means a terrible film, but it is also far from being a realized work.	0
Romantic comedy with a fresh perspective just doesn't seem to play in the current Hollywood schedule.	0
A lame comedy.	0
depressingly thin and exhaustively constructed. Only masochistic moviegoers need apply.	0
A film captivated by mediocrity. not bad, but not so good. Bacon keeps things interesting, but don't bother paying full price.	0
What's next? rob schneider, dana carvey and sarah michelle gellar in the philadelphia story? david spade as citizen kane?	0
does not seem to get near the center of history.	0
The problem, surprisingly, is the script.	0
it's a frankenstein monster of a film that doesn't know what it wants to be.	0
The upper west side practises narcissism and self-congratulation disguised as recognition.	0
On its icy face, the new film is a subzero version of monsters. without their imagination, visual charm or structure.	0
I can't say enough: this film is about a grown man in pink suits.	0
It's a pointless action flick with a twist - much better suited for video viewing than multiplex.	0
After a while, the only way for a reasonably intelligent person to get around the country is to think about how a whole section of pop music history could become wet, fuzzy and sticky.	0
We get a few light emotional shivers, but then - strangely - they fade into a contradictory and ultimately unsatisfactory drizzle.	0
Summer is far too fleeting to waste.	0
The film conveys its social message in stark contradiction, if any.	0
often dwells on the irrelevant as well as on the committed, which gradually raises the question of what time it is. How long is this film?	0
It's a pity Kramer couldn't be there to raise the spirits.	0
deuces wild is an encyclopedia of clichés that shamelessly extracts itself from films like The Wanderers and a Bronx story without destroying its intelligence.	0
It is a barely bearable lurch across worn ground.	0
Epps has neither the charisma nor the natural affability that made Tucker a star.	0
It's sweet.   but a bit too valuable at the beginning and too familiar at the end.	0
A boring, silent and derivative horror film.	0
An embarrassingly contrived exercise in magical realism.	0
Demme gets a lot of flavour and spice in his remake of the charade, but he can't hide the fact that he's scavenging up leftovers that aren't as extensive or fresh.	0
This is a heartfelt story.   It's just not very engaging.	0
These self-styled athletes have had their brains driven so often and so furiously that their ability to explain themselves is as strong as their natural instinct for self-maintenance.	0
"The fact that the ""best part"" of the film comes from a 60-second homage to one of Demme's good films does not bode well for the rest."	0
Richard Pryor dug out his personal horrors and found a treasure chest full of material, but the law usually gives us the gold of fools.	0
The drumline shows are hot.   [But] from the point of view of the mere plot, the film is ice cold.	0
Based on the premise that the middle-class arcanes are monster-truck-loving good-ol-boys and peroxide-blonde honeys whose worldly knowledge comes from TV shows and tabloids.	0
a ridiculous - or rather ridiculous - excuse for a movie.	0
The sequel is everything the original was not: invented, covered and finished.	0
Like a grinning lamppost, his apparent joy comes from a lobotomy, after all his vital essences have been eroded and discarded.	0
A sentimental hybrid that could benefit from the spice of specificity.	0
Well-known and predictable, and 4 / 5 of it might as well have come from a Xerox machine, rather than (writer and director) Franken. reyes' word processor.	0
Shapiro, Goldmann and Kuehnert have good intentions, but there's nothing they couldn't have done in half an hour.	0
It's so free of joy and energy that even Jason X does it.   By comparison, they look downright shaky.	0
A little objectivity could have made a difference.	0
one of the worst movies of 2002.	0
I think he had the best intentions here, but he just doesn't have the capacity to implement them fully.	0
plays like an unbalanced mixture of graphic combat material and almost sacharine, Hollywood-like interludes.	0
The remake of Mctiernan may be a little lighter - the sober original was as graceful as a tap-dancing rhino - but it's just as boring and obvious.	0
High crimes carry almost no organic intrigue as government / naval / legal secrecy, and that's because the film almost subliminally serves all this stuff as an old-fashioned province of male intrigue	0
This film is about the worst thing Chan did in the United States.	0
For me, the explosion essentially ruined - or rather overwhelmed - the fiction of film.	0
This ridiculous film is predictable at every turn.	0
An incredibly irritating comedy about thoroughly empty people.   manages to embody the worst excesses of the Nouvelle Vague without losing any of its sense of fun or energy.	0
The film sinks more and more into comedic futility.	0
Instead of a balanced film that explains the zeitgeist of X-Games, we get a cinematic postcard that is superficial and unrealized.	0
The brusqueness of this reactionary thriller is only achieved by the ridiculousness of its premise.	0
I wish it was just an exaggeration rather than trying to have it both ways.	0
The superior plot line is not quite enough to carry the dead weight of the other.	0
The film doesn't really care about the thousands of Americans who die horrendously, it cares about how Ryan meets his future wife and starts with the police.	0

After an hour and a half of wondering - sometimes amusing, sometimes impatient - about what this extremely unconventional film is supposed to be, you realize that the answer is as conventional as possible.	0
'linklater fans or sophisticated guys who want to appear avant-garde will join this project.	0
is a lamentably boring, redundant concept that, despite iwai's vaunted empathy, bears more than a hint of exploitation.	0
Screenwriter Chris Verweil is good-natured and never boring with his directorial debut, but his virtues are small and slightly overshadowed by his predictability.	0
If you really want to understand what this story is really about, you are much better served with the source material.	0
It's mildly sentimental, unabashedly consumerist.   Carefully harmless and completely disposed of.	0
like the title character, esther kahn is unusual, but unfortunately also irritating	0
"The star, who helped make ""Hunting Me"" and ""Lane Change,"" falls flat as thinking man and agent Jack Ryan in the new action film ""The Sum of All Fears"" this summer."	0
A summary of the plot does not do justice to the horror of the film, which is expressed all too painfully in the execution.	0
Every conceivable mistake a director could make in making operas has been made here.	0
"Snoots will no doubt rally to their cause, spitting out specious standbys like ""Masterpiece"" and ""Triumph"" and all that maloche, but seldom does an established filmmaker waste viewers ""time so passionately with such a gluttony."	0
"[The] film's taste for ""shock humor"" will be limited to everyone except those weaned off the comedy of Tom Green and the Farrelly Brothers."	0
Any kind of pleasure will depend on a personal threshold to watch sad but lovable characters do extremely unconventional things.	0
If the legendary Shlockmaster Ed Wood had ever made a film about a vampire, it would probably look very much like this alarming production based on the novel The Vampire Chronicles.	0
The film is not a nuanced portrait of a young woman's breakdown, but it nevertheless works up some scare stories.	0
endlessly dreary, not to mention boring.	0
Things get really strange, if not terribly scary: the film is all nonsense and no content.	0
